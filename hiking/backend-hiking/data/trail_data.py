Gulf power has started cracking-down on the moto-cross folks. Since then, less motorcycle traffic has helped these trails to be much more fun as they are becoming less sandy. Take the trail and enjoy the long down hill journey, because the upcoming long uphill battle seems endless. Eventually you will make it back to a dirt road near the parking area. Go across the road and the trail will continue mostly downhill to the power lines at 10 Mile Road.  Once there, hang a left and go up this massive hill -- follow the power-lines and when you reach the top of the second hill, look for another trail entrance to your left. The trail starts again at a mound of dirt (if you make to Pate Road, you have gone too far). This trail will bring you back to the parking area. The end of the trail is marked by a small bridge with a tree stump nailed to a tree. Upon exiting the trail, go to the left and the parking area is at the top of the hill. The trail is free. The loop is about 45 min fast---1.5 hours at a slow pace.  Other links: Maps to this trail, and others in the Pensacola area can be found at: http://www.students.uwf.edu/lsg1/mountain.htm<br />\r\nXC riders take the XC entrance (the right fork on the fire road near the gate), looping around & exiting onto the fire road just past The Hip. <br />\r\nFR riders usually take the FR entrance (the left fork off the fire road just passed the XC entrance), starting on The Spooky Trail, rolling through The Hip, Section 8, A51 & over to The Playground.",

It began with 40 acres of city-owned land inside the city limits near the old Beaver Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant. When Wells Fargo Bank added 60 nearby acres to the 40 already owned by the city, the vision to do something even bigger began to form. Eventually, about 400 acres were secured and submitted to Alabama 's Forever Wild program, which identifies land to be protected forever as a natural preserve.The beginner trail and pump track opened in 2015. \r\n\r\nThe rest of the trails opened on October 1, 2016 and are a 10 mile system consisting of six separate trail loops linked together by connectors/bridges. The Trails are accessed from 3 parking lots, one off of Flowers Chapel Road and two off of Fortner Street. \r\n\r\nThe trails are typically open from 6:30 am until dark unless they are undergoing maintenance.\r\n\r\nRead more at http://www.dothan.org/index.aspx?nid=544.",

Dothan has pretty slim-pickins as far as bike trails, this trail would be good for just straight-out big ring laps for building stamina or for new riders just getting the feel for riding on dirt.  While you can really cruise on this trail since it's hard-packed and flat, beware of the walkers and joggers out there.  There is also a BMX track at the park, but it is only open for practice or races: http://www.wiregrassbmx.com/ .  \r\nHere is the Westgate Park website for more info:  http://www.dothan.org/depts/leisure/leisurewestgate.htm",

    "description": "If you start the trail from the dam at the far end of the State Park (farthest you can drive after passing through the gate), you ride across the grass dam and up into some logging area.  There's a small sign that directs you to the \"hiker's trail,\" and it starts with a pretty steep single track with wooden steps built in.  After that, the first half of the 3.6 mile loop is mostly single track, and even though the gate guard said maintenance hadn't been out there this season yet, it was in pretty good condition.  There are some bridges built in across most of the brooks, and the riding is moderately easy, with some ups and downs and some tricky sections.  After that, the trail starts to open up into a wider, double-track(ish) kind of route that is a lot hillier, with some good ups and downs.  At the very end of the trail, it dumps you out onto some horse trails, so be prepared for some loose sand and mud if there's been any rain.  There are a couple of places where you can turn right or left, and I always went left, which brought me back to the entry gate of the state park.  From there its about a mile and a half on the roads of the park to get back to where you parked your truck/car.\r\n\r\nIt's a pretty quick ride, but as there doesn't seem to be many good trails around here, its a nice little afternoon 30 minute ride.  There was really only one place where a tree made me \"bushwhack,\" and that wasn't bad at all.  Very pleased!         \r\n",

Eventually dumps you out on access road for about 1/8 mile, walk the bike, too sandy. Singletrack then starts, go right or left off of the road. Very narrow, slightly sandy. Places that are too sandy, carpet has been laid down, about 2 feet across. The vegetation provides for a low pine tree canopy, but, the best parts it closes in around you and over you, making it very, very tight and slow, but challenging to keep your balance. Some places become so thick and low, long board walks snake through the large patches and 3 feet over the ground. Very enclosed. It's actually quite scenic, feels other worldly. Very leisurely. No climbs, no downs. It's a nice ride for a vacation @ the great beaches. It's worth it just for the odd vegetation and to get away from everybody. There will probably be nobody else back there, these were just constructed in spring '02. Leads to the better known East Lake trail that has a parking lot.",

But there are two shorter intersections that allow you to do 3.5 miles (Yellow) or 5.5 miles (Red).  The trail switches back and forth from double track logging road to singletrack.  There is no water at this place.  Maps are available at the Info Kiosk at the trail head.  This trail has LOTS of sand.  There are some sections that are practically unrideable.  You'd have to dismount and walk your bike through it.  For the most part, the intersections are well marked, but several are not completely clear - like they'll have a color in the middle of a 3-way T, but not tell you exactly which one to take.  Only after going a little ways down do you see another indicator.  In mountian biking, that's little more than a nuisance, but if I were cave diving, taking the wrong route because the paths are not marked well can get you killed.  It's a good ride and long enough to get in some exercise, but be warned about the sand!!!",

Easy to follow the trails with yellow horseshoes marking the way, and a fun place to explore the beautiful scenery of the Talladega National Forrest.",

    "description": "Well maintained singlletrack trails through mature pine forest and some bottoms. There are a few hilly spots and some fast downhills at times. Due to the tree canopy, these trails stay relatively shaded and can be ridden all year. The trails are well maintained by local riders, so the trails are usually clean, open and fast. Minimal sandy spots with the vast majority of the trails being hardpacked dirt with not much roots. Good Trail system.\r\n\r\nThe spot 277THD on the map is at the top of the steep hill, 1/4 mile West of Jackson road on the right. Take this singletrack and follow the arrows for 1.7 miles. This will eventually dump you back on the paved trail. For more single track, get back on the paved trail and continue along the paved, or take connecting singletrack (8-Mile) trail until you come to the pipeline crossing. Go left along pipeline for 300' and singletrack starts on your left and right. (Pipeline trails and Death Valley Trails)\r\n\r\nAnother 5 miles here\r\n\r\nThere is a new trail section that has been added, a total of 6.50-7.0 miles of singletrack is now in place. The topo map above does not show the \"rails to trail\" paved trail, which basically cuts across the center of the map between the two loops.\r\n\r\nEnthusiastic group heading up this trail system.

One will be the Lower River trail and the Yellow Jacket trail. The Lower River will run into the Yellow Jacket trail so you will be one the correct trail at that point. After exiting the Yellow Jacket you will be on the Main Trail until you come to another side trail called the Haire Trail. This will loop around until it exits back on to the Main Trail. Continue on the Main Trail crossing the power line right way and then back into the woods. You will still be on the Main Trail running south. You will come up on two parts of the trail that are called the Ledges. They are named that way because you are riding along the ledge by the river and there are roots involved. You will continue south until on the Main Trail and cross under the Oakridge Bridge. Continue south. As you make the first climb you have two choices, continue straight or turn on a side trail that will loop around and come back to the Main Trail. You will come to another side loop which drops off and rails up against a banking so you can carry a lil speed with that. It too will return to the Main Trail. The next right will be the Tall Pines Loop with has a small drop off on it as it enters into the pines. You will follow this trail until you come up on Soggy Bottom. Follow Soggy Bottom out to Wells Ave. The Main Trail will go back into the woods about 200 yards east on Wells Ave. Follow the Main Trail back North. You will come to an area along the river which will turn left and you have an two options to get down to the next part of the trail. A drop off or ride down the slanted trail back to the Main trail. Continue on the trail through the ditch, in and out, and make one good climb later as you continue. You will have an option to ride the Tall Pines Trail , the high speed drop off and the side trail again before you reach Oakridge Bridge. After passing under the bridge you will come to two signs one says Main Trail and the other is the Fox Trail. The Fox is a return trail that goes west of the river away from the Main Trail. Follow it back to the powerlines and continue back into the woods. You will see another yellow sign to follow. Once back into the woods you will stay left to continue on the Fox Trail or option out to run the Haire Trail in reverse. The Fox Trail will take you back to the trail head.\r\n**********2015 Update **********\r\n\r\nThe trails are very clear at this time. 04/19/15  The trails are no longer just an out and back. There is a return trail added which makes it a loop. You can ride it many different ways. So mileage will vary.  I added a map pending approval.

Then go R/T and follow the trail till you come to the Field. Stay left on Field until you come to the parking lot for the field. At this point you can either follow the road to the R/T or look across the field to the right a little (North-East) and take the Side Trail to the Creek Ford Crossing (Bear Creek) (I would take side trail). If you take the road just follow it to top of hill where it dead ends and look to your R/T. It switch-backs and you can follow it down to Creek Ford Crossing (Bear Creek). The Creek Ford Crossing is wide and deep and has a very sandy bottom. It is hard to impossible to cross on a bike. To get to the better trails on the other side you are going to have to get your shoes wet and full of sand (A bridge is severely needed here). Once on the other side go R/T and go uphill, follow trail till you make your way back down to Bear Creek. Go R/T and follow the creek till you come to the falls. Great place to rest and take a dip. I think there is a small loop at this end but if you don't see it just head back and follow the creek all the way back to the Creek Ford Crossing. Cross the creek and follow either trail back to the parking lot. \r\nI will not ride these trails again until they add a bridge or make trails on the South side of Bear Creek all the way to the falls and make a crossing at the falls. I don't care to trash my bike shoes and ride with sandy wet feet. This place has potential to be great but for now it's not.\r\n\r\nI only rode a little of the East trails and got lost because they are not marked.

Almost all of the initial two trails are singletrack and there seems to be a large amount of unused woods back there just begging for new trails.  These are NICE tight, twisty, technical, rocky, singletrack that makes you pay for your gains but they won't totally sap your flow and keep you at a snails pace either. Many parts of these trails reminded me a lot of Blankets Creek just up the road in Cherokee county and in my book that's a HUGE compliment.  Keep your eyes open for dogs and hikers but they are few and far between.\r\n\r\nNight riding allowed, but the park closes at 11pm.",

If this is confusing, drop in on one of the bike shops in Rome and they can hand draw you a map like they do for many riders.

    "description": "Monte Sano offers a network of trails to make just about everyone happy. You'll find a web of over 60 miles of trails crisscrossing more than 3,700 acres of public property and some private property on the mountain. On the top of the mountain smooth and relatively flat trails await you, while the more adventurous can take the plunge off the plateau. There you'll find plenty of rocks to make you fully appreciate your suspension. Plus, there are short and medium length verticals that will either pump your legs, or numb your hands.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMonte Sano State Park contains the best variety of trails on the mountain. Families can ride down the gravel road to the old fire tower, or even continue on the flat double track of the South Plateau Loop to the overlook at O'Shaughnessy Point. For those that want fun, flat and flowing single track, the Bucca Family Bike Trail is the route to take. It meanders along the plateau out to O'Shaughnessy Point and back. Out towards O'Shaughnessy Point, you can even stop and visit the old fire tower. If the trail gets to be too much, there are a few bailout points on the gravel road allowing a quick escape to the gravel road and the easier portion of the South Plateau Loop.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo get a taste of what you'll experience off the plateau, take a quick lap around the North Plateau Loop/Fire Tower Trail loop. In 1.2 miles, rocks, roots, and short climbs expose you to what lies below. So if you can handle this you're ready for the plunge. However, like the Bucca Family Bike Trail, if it gets to be too much, you can easily take a quick detour to campground road. If you're ready for more intermediate fun, try the fast descent down the Sinks Trail from the biker's parking lot. Keep on the Sinks Trail after you get to its first intersection with the Mountain Mist Trail. It will work its way back around granting you exit on the easier half of the Mountain Mist Trail.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow, if that doesn't satisfy your appetite, or you're just ready for more advanced and technical riding then read on. The southern half of the Mountain Mist Trail rolls along just under the cliff line of the plateau. Plenty of rock and technical features abound. Also try out the Goat Trail, which includes our best rock gardens, switchbacks, rock armoring, and wooden features. The Keith Trail and the Logan Point Trail together feature some of our better climbs and flowing technical aspects. Cold Springs, McKay Hollow, and Warpath Ridge, feature highly technical downhill sections, or ascents--depending on which way you go. Some parts are double black diamond and may involve hiking your bike.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor long sections of advanced riding, the Land Trust's side of the mountain has it. Try out the long climb/descent of the Fagan Spring/Wildflower to Toll Gate to Cold Springs Trail combo. You can work your way from the bottom all the way to the top of the mountain. It starts off as tight technical rocky single track then changes to rough old road bed (1800's toll road) and back again. If you can make the whole thing you are an animal. The Toll Gate-High Trail-Bluffline loop features everything from tough climbs to fast and technical contour single track to crazy downhill with plenty of drops.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThose who want epic rides won't be disappointed either. From the Land Trust Parking Lot and Trailhead on Bankhead Parkway, follow this route: Toll Gate Trail to High Trail to Bluffline Trail to the South Monte Sano Trailhead on Monte Sano Boulevard. From the South Monte Sano Trailhead, take the Arrowhead Trail to its final end at the Natural Well Trail (the Arrowhead and Natural Well trails intersect three times), and then take the Natural Well Trail to the McKay Hollow Trail, which was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the 1930's. Take a right on the McKay Hollow Trail and continue for about a mile along the natural bench in the mountain until the trail begins a 0.75-mile ascent up to the South Plateau Loop (there is some hike-a-bike on this section). Take a right on the South Plateau Loop to O'Shaughnessy Point and take the Mountain Mist Trail down to the Goat Trail. Then take the Goat Trail past the Warpath Ridge Connector and continue to the Flat Rock Connector Trail. Take the Flat Rock Connector to the Flat Rock Trail, and turn left on the Flat Rock Trail. Take the Flat Rock Trail all the way out to Flat Rock and continue on back to the Land Trust Parking Lot and Trailhead.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe suggested \"Epic Route\" provides 18 miles of advanced technical riding and is not suitable for beginners. You'll conquer at least three long climbs, and of course, descents to match, along with numerous rock gardens. When the Flat Rock Trail is wet and during hunting season, skip the Flat Rock Trail and incorporate any of the trails inside the State Park into your route; most of the Flat Rock Trail runs on private hunting land and is closed during hunting season. You can get as much as 50 miles of riding with minimal repeat of any trail, even during hunting season.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAn exhaustive map of all of the trails on Monte Sano Mountain is available from the City of Huntsville website at http://www.huntsvilleal.gov/gis/gis_maps/pdfs/MonteSanoTrails.pdf. Note that this map does not indicate distances or difficulty levels of the trails. The Monte Sano State Park map indicates difficulty levels for all of the trails within its jurisdiction but it is slightly outdated as all of the trails are now open to biking. Hiking is also allowed on all of the trails on Monte Sano.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile riding be sure to look out for the 300 ft. Natural Well along the Natural Well Trail, the many sink holes, the above ground caves called the Stone Cuts, the overlooks of the valley below, and of course, the wild goats, deer, squirrels, and snakes that are often encountered on the trails. If riding on the Flat Rock Trail, be sure to check out the geological formation known as \"Flat Rock\".<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome of the trails have some historical significance. The McKay Hollow and Natural Well trails were constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the 1930's, before Monte Sano State Park was first opened. Parts of the Sinks Trail, Mountain Mist Trail, and Logan Point Trail were originally part of an old wagon road that connected Huntsville with Ryland, Maysville, and Gurley before the advent of the automobile brought about the construction of the paved roads that are now used for that purpose. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMost of the Fire Tower Trail and South Plateau Loop were originally parts of a carriage road system that led to the homes of Robert Fearn and James O'Shaughnessy, who lived on top of the plateau during the 1800's. The ruins of these homes can be accessed from the Fire Tower Trail, where historic markers provide additional information about them. Ruins of the historic Monte Sano Railroad and the Hotel Monte Sano can also be seen at various locations on the mountain. A number of springs and spring house ruins also dot the sides of the mountain, and running waterfalls can be seen during the spring and fall at a number of locations. The Monte Sano State Park and Huntsville Land Trust websites (as well as rangers at the State Park campground office) can provide additional information regarding the rich history of the mountain, which dates back well before the American Civil War. Additional landmarks on Monte Sano include the Burritt Museum and Park near the South Monte Sano Trailhead on top of Round Top Mountain, which hosts a few short trails as well as the historic mansion built by local physician Dr. William Burritt early in the 1900's.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThose who prefer more modern history and thrills may want to take a trip into town to visit the US Space and Rocket Center.",

The trails (old &amp; new) are all currently open (before the official ribbon cutting), but they are still installing trail signs and other facilities-related items.\n\nThe Main loop is a Bi-directional trail that is .75 miles long with some decent climbing and some fun and easy descents. The main loop is a good place to take a beginner as it will show them some decent mountain biking without it being to hard where they will hate the sport. There is now a fork in the trail about half way through the main loop which you cant miss although there is no sign. Once you take the fork there can be some two way traffic in that section as when you return you must take that connector. Once you have finished there is some technical punchy climbs and a wooden feature. I have found the best route is to take the right all the way to the top of the hill as you will be pretty much parallel to the road. Once at the top just take the single-track on the left and enjoy your hard work. Go down to the creek relax a little and then begin the climb to the main loop.",

This is some of the most demanding singletrack in Middle Georgia with great climbs and fast downhills. The park also offers lake access and camping. \r\n\r\nThere are two loops that are well marked, a Beginner loop as well as an Advanced loop. The Beginner loop takes out a couple of the longer climbs but it's still a challenging ride. To reach both trail heads you'll take the first paved road to your left once you enter the part, at the bottom of the hill you'll see the trail kiosk with the Advanced trail starting to the left of the bathrooms. To reach the Beginner trailhead you'll need to ride up the road a few hundred feet and you'll see the trailhead on your left. An additional 2 or so miles of trail to be built finished later this year!

There are three possible lefts to take but for the longest most enjoyable ride go to the end of the trail (ends at Old Clifton Rd) turn around and go back taking your first right. This begins the true single track ride in the small mountains between Fox channel Five and Emory Campus/Peavine Creek). Go over a foot bridge up steep and take every right that seems to be going up hill. You eventually will go down into the first gully over a tough stream crossing follow the trail up a tough steep taking a left once on the creek washout and look for the trail that continues up the mountain. Next is a pretty good down hill and a very dangerous steep section with cut logs and stumps at the very end. Take a right and your back at the beginning. Now do the loop backwards taking a right up the very dangerous steep (with the cut tree stumps) for a great single track ride. This trail is seldom used by mountain bikers because it's more setup for walking. Do not try it in wet conditions because the trail is very steep in places and you'll be pushing your bike up the whole way. This is a short trail but very technical and not a beginner trail. The river crossings and up hills are technical. You'll be huffing ands puffing for sure: 1.4 mile loop several variations. If you live in the Highlands.

Many rock garden type crossings, going up and downhill, and a good number of roots in certain areas. The best thing is to go check it out and decide which way you want to ride the trails. There are also some 4x4 trails that run on a gas line clearing that provide some fun riding also. You could easily put together a longer ride just by using the different options of trails that are there. Technically the signs say hiking trails but bikes are allowed to ride there right now.

The Dwelling Loop tends to have a faster pace than it's sister trails in the area and the downhill sections are VERY rewarding.  Watch for hikers, you may encouter one or two while riding this loop.  They are required to travel opposite the direction of bike flow to help limit dangerous encounters.",

    "description": "Blankets Creek is one of the premiere mountain bike trail systems in the Atlanta Metro Area. While perhaps not technically in the metro area (depends who you ask), this Woodstock trail is close enough to the city to draw a flood of riders up here every day of the week.\n\nThanks to the popularity, SORBA Woodstock has recently been able to vastly expand the parking area and add new trailhead facilities, such as flush toilets.\n\nAs for the trails themselves, Blankets Creek is an excellent example of a stacked-loop trail system. Short, flat, easy trails are accessible right from the parking lot for beginner riders, but keep heading further in and you'll experience intermediate singletrack as well as advanced trails full of rocks, jumps, berms, and some serious exposure.\n\nWhile Blankets is definitely busy and can get crowded sometimes, the reputation and the popularity has been well-earned. Directional travel (depending on day) helps keep the trails from feeling too congested once you get away from the parking lot, so if you have never ridden at Blankets Creek before, be sure to carve time out of your schedule to do so!",

It's very challenging with total climbing of 2388 feet in 8 miles and total descending of 2732 feet in 8 miles.  In this section you will ride over 4 mountains with minim elevation of about 1000 feet and max elevation of about 1800 feet. Be prepared to be on the trail around 3 hours if you are an average rider.  Bring more water and gells than you think you need, it's a tough one.  Roots, rocks, big rocks, little rocks and roots.  I reccommend trying this one with someone who knows the trail first.  You can check out NWGA SORBA Forum(http://www.nwgasorba.org/chewdafat/index.php), there'ss always peole who are posting rides to the \"Snake\" and would be glad to take first-timers.  You can do this ride as a semi out and back by riding the road back (which makes total ride about 24 miles), you can do this as a shuttle ride back(takes 2 cars obviously), or if you are a bad-a$$, you can ride the actual trail out-and-back for 32 miles of some serious trail riding.

    "description": "<b>Updated description by mtbgreg1, circa 2010:</b>\r\n\r\nDetailing one specific route at Big Creek is impossible. I will cover the area in detail below and attempt to include directional information as I do so, but it will be up to you to choose the best route after that. Don't worry, the trail signage is very thorough and will be sufficient to keep you from getting too turned around.\r\n\r\n<b>Cross Country Mountain Biking</b>\r\nThe 6 or so miles of cross-country oriented singletrack trails of Big Creek are well-maintained, well-marked, and entertaining to ride. The trails are labeled with different colors based on their level of technical difficulty, so its easy to pick the trail that will serve your needs the best. \r\n\r\nThe black/advanced trails feature plenty of rocks, some log rides and other features, a few stiff climbs, and a couple of drop offs. \r\n\r\nMost of the trails are directional, so check the signs and pay attention to what day of the week it is! \r\n\r\n<b>Downhill</b>\r\nWhile the cross-country trails are pretty cool, Big Creek's true claim to Atlanta area fame are its downhill and dirt jump-oriented trails. From what I hear, there is really no other place in Atlanta with this kind of riding, and possibly only 1 other place in the state of Georgia with downhill-specific trails! There are about 5-7 different trails to choose from packed tightly together on a hill side located about a mile down the greenway. There are also a number of rock drops spread throughout the area, with 4 or so on the backside of the upper ridge dropping down towards a maintained park.\r\n\r\nI've ridden my All Mountain bike down many of these trails before, and I've heard people say that they really don't live up to true downhill-oriented trails.  While that may be true, I know that I definitely don't feel comfortable on a 5\" travel bike bike when:\r\npinning it (that means going completely balls-out high-speed for those not familiar with moto lingo) through the rock gardens containing mini boulders and 3 foot drops after many of the rocks\r\nsending a 3 foot high booter to a super long landing (where you could get as much air as you want)\r\nairing a 15 ft long table top\r\ndoing various rock drops ranging from 4ish feet to 7-8 feet\r\nBearing in mind that these trails are located in Atlanta, I'd say the terrain is pretty freaking sweet!\r\n\r\n<b>Dirt Jumps</b>\r\nBig Creek has a dedicated line of high-quality purpose-built dirt jumps that run along the top of the ridge above the other downhill and freeride runs. There are a mix of different size jumps ranging from relatively small to one with a lip that's pushing 6 feet high or more. To the best of my knowledge, there is nowhere else in Atlanta, or even the state of Georgia for that matter, with an area that even comes close to comparing to the near-professional grade of these jumps. While most of the riders I have seen sessiong them have been on dirt-jumping mountain bike frames, I've witnessed a number of BMXers sending it big time as well. \r\n\r\n<b>Slalom Course</b>\r\nLocated directly in the center of all of the action, the banked slalom-type course seems to be the focal point of all the attention. It is appropriate that all the other trails seem to be built around it, as riders of all different disciplines can navigate the slalom run. For instance, when I was last out at Big Creek, I saw a kid on a rigid single speed 29er rolling down through the berms. \r\n\r\nSo granted, the big berms and flow are going to be accessible to anyone on almost any bike. To really rail this trail and air out the big table tops, however, you're going to need to be riding something much more aggressive than a rigid SS 29er. A dirt jump bike would be perfect for this kind of work, and a BMX bike or a downhill bike would also function passably, despite being on opposite ends of the bicycle-size spectrum. \r\n\r\n<b>Pumptrack</b>\r\nOne of the newest additions to Big Creek is a pumptrack with beginner and advanced lines. Come here to get your first taste of rollers and berms, or to rack the speed up and get your flow on!\r\n\r\n<b>Night Riding:</b> \r\nNight riding at specific times, with approved leaders only.",

It is actually the same granite that makes up the semi-famous tourist attraction, Stone Mountain, to the northwest.  Follow the painted arrows and \"read the rocks\" to stay on the trail.  It can be a little tricky the first time so bring a map.  For the most part, you can tell where the trail runs by the discoloration of the rock from bike tires.  While only about a mile or so is actually on the granite, this trail can give you the feel of riding on the moon at times.

You can add the John's Mountain Scenic Overlook as an out-n-back to make this ride about 12.5 miles long.  With the addition, you will climb upwards to 2000ft in the 12.5miles.  <br />\r\nDirection: when in the Pilcher's Pond parking lot, head strait out through the gates for about a mile of double track.  You will pass a small pond on the right then a larger pond on the left.  As you pas the larger pond on the left, you will cross a bridge (this starts the singletrack).  From here you will come to a fork in the trail with a Pinhoti Trail sign.  Continue up the hill in the direction in which you came (the trail to the left is the one you'll be coming back on). Continue on the Pinhoti Trail for a few miles of flowing, swooping singletrack until you come to another split in the trail...this time the Pinhoti turns right, but you will need to turn left.  Follow this down the hill until you hit a gravel road climb.  Continue with the climb, followed by a small creek crossing and a downhill until you come to a Paved road...this is Pocket road.  Turn left onto the paved road and follow it for about 1.5 miles (uphill mostly) until you come to the John's mountain overlook road on the right.  Turn right up the overlook road for about 3/4 mile until you come to the first sweeping right turn.  Once in this turn, you will see the Pinhoti trail to your right (going uphill).  This is the turn back towards the car if you do not want to do the 13 miler (which is the overlook addition)... for the elevation and mileage, continue up the following 2.5 miles of climbing until you come to the scenic overlook.  It's a challenging climb, but has a nice view and a fun downhill.  Once you're finished catching your breath, head back down the overlook road to the Pinhoti trail on the left.  Start up the Pinhoti trail, it will climb for about 1/2 miles followed by some fun, kinda steep, singletrack that mellows out for a few miles until it hits Pocket road again.  At this point, Cross Pocket road and continue with the Pinhoti Singletrack until you come to another \"T\"  At this point turn right and it's about 1.5 miles to the car.  If you want to do the figure 8 again, then turn left again up the pinhoti (at the previously mentioned \"T\")..<br />\r\nI'm sorry if this sounds complicated, it's really not hard to navigate.  It's well ridden, well groomed and well marked.  For any concerns or if you want a guide, check the NWGA Sorba website.  www.nwgasorba.org has their own forum, if you post on it that you want a tour of this trail or any of their local trails, you'll be sure to have a guide or 2 readily available.",

However SORBA Atlanta has been hard at work. They have been doing reroutes around badly worn areas and have more planned in the near future. The trail is a great technical trail with fast, fun downhills, some gut busting uphills, a few rock gardens and a new ladder bridge over a fallen tree. There are two sides to the trail: the dirt side and the granite side. The trail does cross horse paths so keep an eye out for them. SORBA also has some beginners trails in the works. It is a great place to ride with great scenery and nothing but the sounds of nature, once you get back into the trails.",

The Blue loop incorporates the trails from the Green loop and adds in the old school trails to bring the total mileage to 7.5 miles.  The Red loop throws everything Bartram has to offer.  It pieces together both singletrack sections in different ways from the Blue and Green loops, letting you ride the most fun segments in the direction they were built to flow the best and adds in some forest roads to incorporate more climbs and some fast downhills.

    "description": "This trail is a blast!!! It's fairly technical, and i promise you won't leave unsatisfied. There are abundant climbs and decents. Get you a good set of grippy tires, the trail tends to get muddy after rain, and has parts that are covered with roots.  There are a few spots where you ride the side of a small ravine, and a few stream crossings.  Plenty of hard turns and technical spots. Two or three big decents (fast as s#@!) It's a great time. Be careful, and be sure to stop by and see the guys at Oconee Outfiters.  They're super helpful, and will be glad to make sure you get to the trail. \r\nUPDATE:  A new trail head has been built at the intersection of Vinson Hwy and Laying Farm Road.  It has a kiosk (with map, history and flora information) and a 2 stall changing room.  The new 0.75 out and back connector trail gets you to the original trail which has now grown to just over 5 miles.  With the connector trail, you will be riding about 7.5 miles to finish a lap at Selma and will be experiencing almost 1,000' of climb.  It is still a BLAST!",

The lower points of this trail are nearly always a little bit damp and tacky, but the trail is rideable nearly year-round because it drains so well into Bear Creek. There are several creek crossings and switchbacks to make things fun. Stop and take a picture at the Gannet Poplar, a very old and massive tree along the trail. Numerous trailheads are in the area, but the preferred route is to park on Gates Chapel Rd and ride up FS 90 to the small parking area where the singletrack starts.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nFrom the parking area, ride up the gravel road, bearing left at the sign for the Bear Creek trail approx. 1 1/2 miles to the trailhead (there is a small parking area at the trailhead, but we always ride the gravel road as a warm-up).  There are two trails here, but take the one beside the information kiosk. The other way is not meant for humans. After crossing a small, rocky creek, stay left at the sign for the Bear Creek Loop trail.  After climbing two short whoops right beside the creek, follow the hard left switchback uphill (do NOT cross the logs and continue straight). Continue up the singletrack to the forest service gate.  At the grassy clearing, continue to the LEFT, uphill on the doubletrack.  After crossing through a wide but shallow creek, go left downhill to the gate and onto the gravel road.  Turn right on the gravel road and continue up approx. 1/2 mile to the overlook.  Enjoy the view!  Continue to ride up the gravel road another couple hundred yards to the sign for the upper parking lot.  Turn into the lot and follow the singletrack trail downhill.  There are several hard switchbacks and the trail will dump you out back at the wide shallow creek.  Continue the ride back downhill the same way you climbed up!",

It's a really fun piece of trail!  This one isn't on the map yet, but the route is pretty easy to follow.  At one spot it hits the road, and you have to hang a left and a quick right (if you are climbing from Jake TH) to pick up the trail. \r\n\r\nUpdate 7/11/13: \r\n\r\nSince the time this trail was added to Singletracks, other trails have been built in the Bull Mountain trail system with a similar design. Also, this trail now sees a lot of traffic since it serves as the main conduit between the Jake Mountain and Bull Mountain trailheads.

    "description": "The Bull / Jake Mountain system is full of single track and there is plenty of fast downhill throughout.  The scenery is great, too.  Mountain laurel makes tunnels over parts of the trail and there are creek crossings and waterfalls.  The trails are basically split 30% primative road, 30% doubletrack, 40% singletrack. This area can be confusing so be sure to bring a map! Plenty of forest road intersections and bail out points.\n\nTotal climb for the entire network is about 3,000 feet, though there are several loops you can make with as little as a few hundred feet of climbing each.\n\nUpdate 7/11/13 by mtbgreg1:\n\nSome people have mixed feelings about the Bull/Jake Mountain trail system, one thing is certain: this trail system is one of the premiere mountain bike destinations in North Georgia. Sure, there are better trails in North Georgia, but there are definitely worse trails, too. If you're looking for riding in the Dahlonega/Dawsonville/Helen area, this is undoubtedly the place to go.\n\nThe trails have changed significantly in the past couple of years, and they will continue to change. The US Forest Service has been rerouting many of the trails that were built unsustainably. Again, these reroutes aren't without their detractors (as the new trails are very buff and smooth), but in general the riding in the Bull Mountain area is now the best it has ever been. And with new trails proposed in the coming years, the riding here stands to get even better.\n\nRight now, the trail system can be split into two different halves. The Jake Mountain side of the system (which includes trails such as Jake Mountain, Black Branch, No Tell, Turner Creek and Moss Creek) is, on average, flatter and smoother than the Bull Mountain side of the trail system. If you're not from the mountains, don't let that fool you, though. Despite being flatter than the Bull Mountain side, nothing out here qualifies as \"flat\": you can still easily climb a couple thousand feet in less than 20 miles.\n\nOn the Bull Mountain side of the trail system, the trails on average are steeper, with longer climbs, and are rougher and more technical. The Bull Mountain, Whoops, and Lance Creek trails comprise this half of the system, and the Jake-to-Bull connector and Jones Creek Ridge trails function as the links between the two halves. Consequently, Jones Creek Ridge and Jake-to-Bull have more climbing than the Jake side, but are smoother than the Bull side.\n\nWithout a doubt, the full Bull Mountain loop is the main challenge, with long, steep climbs, fast descents, and some decent rocks to keep things interesting. The Bare Hare trail at the top of the Bull Mountain loop also reaches the highest elevation of any of the mountain bike-legal singletrack trails in the area, providing some pretty cool mountain riding.\n\nWhen you come up here, be warned: this is one of the most popular equestrian trail systems in North Georgia, so be prepared to yield the trail to horses. But don't let that deter you from experiencing the awesome mountain biking!\n\nFor a loop route with the most singletrack riding and the least gravel road, and absolutely NO backtracking, be sure to check out the map for the Dirty Thirty recommended route.",

Trail also has numerous features that include bridges and berms. The trail is very beginner friendly as all technical features have bypasses.\n\nLength:\nOne complete loop approximately 5.5 miles.  Directional arrows, trail names, and mileage signage are posted for trail reference and is intended to direct the rider in a CLOCKWISE direction.\n\nTrail Description:\nBeginning at the trailhead bulletin board (to the right of the park entrance near the front pond) you will ride through the \"Headless Horse\" into \"Freesons\" and the large pipeline right-of-way these sections are smooth, straight and easy riding all bridges/crossings are wide and easy to cross made up of wood &amp; metal grating.  Soon you will enter the \"Wookie Wiggle\" where the trail takes advantage of the terrain to make a twisty fun part of the course. Into the \"Zephr\" and \"G.A.Z.Z.\" you'll experience tight &amp; twisty roller coaster like terrain.   Across a short wooden bridge to \"Seinfeld\" then \"5 Minutes Alone\" these sections are relatively smooth, straight, and fast.  Pass the turn-around and into 'Up-Chuck\" the trail becomes slower and more technical with moderate ups &amp; downs (no significant elevation).  Beware of Indiana Jones warning into \"South Canada\" where you will find the \"8th Wonder Berm\" and several others in a  section of fast and fun turns. Soon there will be a smile from the spillway trail gnome into \"W.D.D.A.M.F.\" &amp; \"Rat Tail\" contain more twisty ups &amp; downs with an assortment of berms and flowy sections.  Soon you will be in the spooky \"Ghost Trail\" where you may encounter the unknown.  You'll finish in the short section of \"Chu-Chut\" to the \"FF Connection\" which will take you to the levee climb and you'll follow the limestone road back to the park and trail head.\n\nEvents:\nSeveral events are head at the trail every year. NOMAMBO host the annual cross country race the Spillway Scramble that is sanctioned by USA Cycling. The race is part of the Louisiana Mountain Bike Championship Series (LMBCS).\n\nAnother popular event open to anyone is the night time race affectionately called Race of the Dead. The Race of the Dead has become a Halloween tradition at the trail with sections of \"haunted trail\" where you never know what to expect.\n\nNOMAMBO also host a yearly Time Trail series. The series is a fundraiser that allows the club to maintaining and improving the trail system. It is a fun competition that pits everyone against each other for one lap on the Bonnet Carre Spillway Trail as fast as you can! Entry fee is $10 and signup is done the half hour before the race starts. Awards include First (Men and Women), DFL (Men and Women), Lucky 13, the Pink Jersey, the Sand-Bagger Award and the Rusty Wrench!\n\nThe trail is also frequently used by running clubs for trail runs. Events like the Warrior Dash are held at the park and utilize sections of the trail.",

I personally find myself riding this loop a lot during the winter, and also combine it with the other nearby forest service roads for more mileage. \r\n\r\nHowever, there is one very deep creek crossing that used to have a bridge over it but does not anymore, but if you head down stream on some of the unmarked singletrack you can cross a shallower spot on some gravel bars.\r\n\r\nRoute: From the church outside of Camp Frank D. Merril (the ranger camp), head left on the gravel road about a quarter of a mile. Turn into the ranger camp under the gate (not the main entrance near the church) and drop down the pavement, past the rec hall. Ride onto the grass and hang around the back side of the rec hall, and then off the back corner hang left and look for the bridge over the creek. \r\n\r\nAfter crossing the creek, continue straight, past some ranger obstacles and onto the gravel. Take the quick left up the hill, and now you're on the main section of gated gravel road.\r\n\r\nFollow that main gravel road until it T's into FS 28-1.

I followed Jim Parham's recommended directions in Off the Beaten Path and rode down the pavement and up West Wolf Creek.  If ever there was a piece of pavement that was worth riding your bicycle down, it is the chunk of Georgia 180 dropping down from Wolf Pen Gap to Vogel State Park. Still, the general wisdom that descending is best down on the gnarliest terrain in the ride always holds true.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo I highly advise you, if you are going to do this ride, to descend West Wolf Creek Road and climb up US 129 and GA 180.  The route is an easy to follow loop using those three roads.  Grab a map and you're good to go for this approximately 8 mile ride.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll About the Trail<br />\r\nWhat good is a trail review database if it only tells you which trails to ride, and not which trails to avoid?  It would be very little use at all.  Despite its inclusion in Jim Parham's popular guide book, Sosebee Cove is one to put in the \"avoid at all costs\" category. As I mentioned above, if you are going to do this ride, do not climb the gravel.  The gravel road is very steep and throughly covered in somewhat sandy, but very dry/loose gravel. It's a beast of a climb, and force me to resort to hiking.  What kind of forest road is rated a hike-a-bike?  Maybe I was just wussing out in the 90+ degree heat and high humidity, but that is a beast of a hill.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEven if you chose to ride down it, what kind of mountain bike ride contains more pavement than gravel, and absolutely no singletrack? \"A really lame one,\" is the appropriate answer.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe kicker that really makes this ride a loser is the fact that there's a ton of buff, beautiful singletrack crossing this route at many points... but it's all closed to mountain bikes! Way to throw salt in my wounds after that murderous climb.  I can officially say I've ridden Sosebee Cove, and can say with authority that I won't be back.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBottom Line<br />\r\nThis is one ride that you should just pass on.",

The trail begins going downhill on forest roads and some pavement.  About 7 miles later, you'll turn onto Canada Creek road and ride past a few farmhouses.  Continue downhill on the rocky and washed out trail until you come to the scenic mountain valley.  Then you will ride double track past a couple old silos and lots of wild flowers.  As you approach the 10 mile mark there will be a few steel beams on the right.  See picture.  You will have to carry your bike over these bridge remains to cross Canada Creek.  Once across, there is  technical single track ahead.  There will be large mounds of dirt in the trail meant to keep ATVs from riding here but it is not difficult to get the average mountain bike over.  After the single track you ride on Gaddistown Road passing more farmhouses.  When the pavement ends there is over a mile of pushing your bike up an extremely steep rocky hill and your thighs start paying for the downhill from the beginning of the ride.  Overall, what I liked about this trail was the scenery and what I really disliked was the lack of single track and discouraging and painful end.",

Once on 44B there is a fairly steady but long climb, followed by a wicked fast downhill.  On the downhill you will have to dodge briers and yell yo bear when, not if, you run across them! \r\n\r\nThere are miles and miles of closed FS roads you can ride in this area, and FS 44 has some pretty good primitive campsites along the entire length of the road.

There are quite a few jumps and features built by the local kids I'd assume but beware of holes dug to make them especially when leaves have fallen.

You'll often find people walking and a few others on bikes.  There are a few scenic spots where you can view a small creek and a long floating bridge that crosses a lake.  I typically park on East Railroad Ave and hop on the red marked trail near the park.  The trail is marked out well with red squares painted on trees or posts.  You'll come to a descending stairway that you can attempt to ride down or to the left side there is enough room to just ride down next to it.  You'll cross a few little bridges and it's mostly smooth.  Nothing technical.  You'll eventually reach Smithville Rd which you cross and continue to follow onto the green marked trail.  That takes you to the lake with the long bridge.  On the other side of that bridge are a couple staircases.  You can go right and ride a small loop for their green trail (not shown on map) or head left and follow back to Smithville Rd.  Smooth riding down their yellow marked trail which leads back to the parking lot on East Railroad Ave.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI will mention that near the first descending staircase I described you'll see to the right a gazebo.  If you ride in that direction and go through the gazebo, there is a singletrack that winds through the trees.  Following that path will eventually lead you either back to the descending staircase or you can see another offshoot trail that heads down a hill with a couple little whips at the bottom.  Nothing difficult.  It's a nice little place to do laps for beginner fitness.  Carrying the bike up and down the staircases adds to the cardio aspect.  This trail system is definitely for beginners.",

The site is not being completely cooperative and even trying to get help from admins has proven ineffective.  The problem is the whole park is split among three towns and those three sections are separate of each other with a impassable creek between them.  The best trail system in my opinion are those found in Westampton.  This site defaults to showing GPS data for Hainesport.  Bring up the Westampton GPS data for a decent loop through various colored trails.  The pictures show the map for the Westampton trail system as well.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe trail system is comprised of mostly singletrack.  You'll find some downed logs to jump or ride over.  Plenty of root covered paths.  Most of the trails are perfectly clear while others are a little overgrown.  The green trail has a Strava segment which is fun to blast through.  It can be found by following the singletrack path to the right of the main gate on Powhatan Drive.  When the path splits, stay to the right.  The paths are easily identifiable by painted markings on the trees.  If nature is your thing you'll come across plenty of squirrels, deer, streams, clearings, wild flowers, and views of the creek.  I'd definitely rate these trails as beginner to intermediate depending on how fast you want to rip through them.",

The trails are marked in colors on the trees.  I typically enter at Deacon Rd. and go straight.  This is the \"blue\" trail.  I follow it till it branches off to the right by the water into singletrack.  There are plenty of roots, some twists, and some hills.  As you follow the path you'll come to two old log cabin ruins.  Passing through here you'll eventually come to the area where the gravel road for Rancocas Rd. ends.  If you keep going straight you'll see the blue markings on the trees to keep on that trail.  After a bit of biking you'll have the choice of turning left or going straight.  I normally go straight and continue on with the \"orange\" trail.  This wraps around the woods on some doubletrack and eventually intersects back with the gravel road.  You can go straight across here and pick up the \"green\" trail.  This trail is all singletrack and you come to a pretty steep hill initially.  After climbing the hill you'll end up following along a ridge then back to some more \"blue\" trail.  There's a lot to this network of trails that I haven't mapped yet so stay tuned for more.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne thing to be wary of, the sand.  There are a few sandy areas which are easy to get through or go around however there are a couple hills where the bottoms can be a slight turn and sandy at times, both of which add to a possible front tire sliding out.

    "description": "Sourland Mountain Preserve, a 2870 acre park, is located in Hillsborough. The riding here can be described very easily; extremely challenging. The Sourlands are not for the beginner rider. The trails are incredibly rocky and slippery. People either ride at the Sourlands once and never go back, or they become addicted to the challenge and ride there all the time. Be prepared to spend a lot of time walking your bike or at least dabbing your foot every few feet. Be sure to climb up the Pipeline for a lung busting aerobic challenge, just see if you can make it up without stopping. The Sourlands become very muddy and slippery after a rainstorm, so please practice responsible trail use. The Sourland Mountain Preserve trails were built, and are maintained to be hiking trails, but from my experience on them, I would not recomend hiking it unless you want a twisted, or even broken ankle/wrist, or even arm/leg. It has happened many many times. Once again, this is not a place for new or intermediate riders, yet it can be extremely fun, if a very challenging ride is your cup of tea!\n\nNOTE: It has been said by many professional and expert riders that this is the most difficult trail to ride in NJ. Basically, if you can survive on this trail then you can survive on any trail in NJ.\n\nAccess to this park is gained by East Mountain Road in Hillsborough.",

The Duck Farm Trail is in the North End of the Park. The trail system isn't marked yet....so the best bet to finding the trail is, vist the Parks Nature Center. The park ranger or naturalist will be able to guide you. Remember, this trail was designed and built by Mountain Bikers...although it's very flat in South Jersey..we've made it as challenging as we could. Also remember....MTBers have the right of way! be polite and say hello to all trail users (if you see horses on the trail, please report it to the park...they aren't allowed on the trail!) The Duck Farm Trail is the only legal single track in Atlantic County, NJ. So take care of it.....WE DON'T WANT TO LOSE IT!

Aside from blazed trails and wood roads crisscrossing around and through it, the only developments are a small parking area, an old any-air gun platform on one of the lookouts, on a cliff, and some dilapidated stone and concrete gates at the edges of the park on some of the old roads. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe three Watchung mountain ranges were formed when molten lava extruded out of the earth's surface and cooled rapidly.  The outcrop at Quarry Point provides not only a scenic lookout of the surrounding area, including the NYC skyline, but also an opportunity to examine the basaltic lava.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTrails Overview:\t<br />\r\nThe park has a network of loop trails totaling six miles.  The seven individual blazed trails range from 0.1-mile up to 1.5 miles.  A 1.5-mile segment of the 34-mile Lenape Trail (yellow blaze) passes through.  A synopsis of each blazed trail and very helpful (if sketchy and informal) map can be seen by heading into park from any of it's woods roads entrances.  The map shows numerous trailheads located at the Normal Avenue parking lot on the northern end of the park.  It can accommodate about 20 cars. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere is some fairly technical single track along  more moderate single track and gravel fire roads. The park has some elevation change  but nothing particularly steep or sustained. The trails leading north east from the cliff lookout in the south of the park are comprised almost exclusively solid \"trap rock\" and makes for some very fun riding. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nOther Points of Note:<br />\r\nThese trails are often used my locals for dog walking but most of the dogs are off leash hear; also there are lots of local kids smoking weed here but everyone at the park seems friendly.",

When it hits the gravel rd go left and stay on it through the campground. Pick up the trail at the end of the camp sites. There is an upper and low section of the trail. I recommend using the upper section as there are less hikers. Follow the trails all the way to the cliff overlooks and continue past to stover park rd. Cross stover rd and go either left or right as the trail just does a maybe 1.5 mile loop back to stover park rd. I recommend going right. Just follow the trail back to the Tohickon Valley Park. Good ride for everyone. Its a blast for how short it is. Some jumps built off the old 19 century farm rock walls. Nice little sprint climbs, fast rocky downhills and some good technical sections. Recommend going during the week as the place really gets crowded on the weekends with hikers, bikers, and climbers.",

    "description": "Sprain Ridge has some very technical sections of log crossings, often two or three in a row spaced about a bike length apart just to make things difficult. \r\n\r\nHere is the description from the official website:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.westchestergov.com/parks/brochures/Trailways/SprainRidgeMain.htm\r\n\r\nSprain Ridge Park is a large land preserve with a variety of landscapes, ranging from heavily wooded areas to large and impressive rock outcroppings. The park was previously owned by the Boyce Thompson Institute, a botanical research center, and a result, contains many unusual and exotic woodland plants. The five miles of mountain bike trails at Sprain Ridge offer challenges to cyclists at every level of ability and are a great complement to the parkís other recreational facilities, which include a swimming pool, playground and picnic areas. The trails wind their way through 278 acres of varied terrain that offers challenges for beginner, intermediate and advanced cyclists. The beginner trail provides cyclists with challenging curves but a relatively level topography.\r\n\r\nThe intermediate and advanced trails provide experienced cyclists with more of a challenge with trails of increasing grades and challenging topography.\r\n\r\nThere are picnic areas available near all three parking lots and a snack bar is open in season near the swimming pool area.\r\n\r\nRemember, people judge all cyclists by your actions, so please act courteously and responsibly. not build new trails or stunts. Have a good time and enjoy your ride.\r\n",

Near the summit of the hill, there is a steep punchy climb with a fallen tree that cuts across the trail. If you choose to descend this way, the tree makes for a nice step down that you can huck at high speeds. In fact, the easiest descent starts with that bit of steep trail and the tree that you probably rode up if you followed the yellow markers. For the easiest descent, turn onto the trail with the blue markers, called Hutcheon. Upon descending you will find yourself at another creek crossing, and from there you may take the yellow or blue trail back to the trailhead. The descent is characterized by mostly flowing terrain, but with the occasional rock garden or unexpected turn. There are a few obstacles to ride such as two creek-crossings and a few steep rocky sections. The entire loop takes no more than 45 minutes.",

    "description": "This ride encompasses all three of the adjacent trail systems of Allamuchy Mountain State Park North, Allamuchy Deer Park, and Stephens State Park.  This ride is a grueling 4 hours (at least) and is not for beginners.  How I like to connect all three parks:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPark on the Sussex branch trailhead at Allamuchy State Park North.  Bike up the sussex branch trail about 4 or 5 miles until you reach the green trail (waving willie) on the left.  From waving willie, make a right onto the white trail and continue on the white trail until you reach the purple trail (cardiac/ditch) on your left.  Turn onto this trail and ride it out until you get to the orange trail, which you merge onto and this finally takes you out of Allamuchy onto county route 517.  Make a left onto county route 517 and climb up the road and over highway route 80 until you see the Mountain Villa School on the left.  Turn into the school and you will bike through the parking lot and down a grass field until the see the Allamuchy lake trail.   To make sure you are going the correct direction, keep the lake to your right.  This makes its way into Allamuchy Deer Park.  Make the first left onto a trail and continue until you see the white trail in Deer Park, which you merge onto (there will be a slight right that you DO NOT want to take).  Continue on the white trail until you see the orange trail on the left, which you will take until it drops you out onto Waterloo Road.  Make a right onto Waterloo Road and then an immediate left onto Kinney Road.  On Kinney Road, you will cross a bridge and then see an iron gate on the left.  Take the trail around the iron gate and you will be in an abandoned parking lot.  There will be a trail to the left of that parking lot that takes you through a quarry and eventually to waterloo valley road.  There will be a trail directly across waterloo valley road.  Take this trail until it ends and make a left.  The trail that you turn left onto is more of a rail trail than singletrack.  This trail will then turn right underneath a railroad and there will be multiple options of singletrack trail that you can take after that.  From there, it gets too confusing to describe the route.  However, if you successfully loop around and back to the trail that goes underneath the railroad, take it again and make a right onto a trail that leads you back to waterloo valley road.  From here, slightly to the right there is a trail that goes downhill and is mostly pavement.  This trail goes underneath route 80 and takes you back to continental drive.  Take a left onto continental drive, and you will be back to the Allamuchy State Park north parking lot! This route is very difficult to explain in words, so I would recommend using a garmin gps route and using your smart phone to do the ride.  Here are a few routes on gps that cover all three parks:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nhttp://connect.garmin.com/activity/298175861<br />\r\n<br />\r\nhttp://connect.garmin.com/page/activity/activity.faces?activityId=32581186&actionMethod=page/activity/activity.xhtml:userSwitcher.switchSystem&cid=2708239<br />\r\n<br />\r\nhttp://connect.garmin.com/page/activity/activity.faces;jsessionid=69189FF9C3959D9BD897DDA5D530EDE9?activityId=33401470&actionMethod=page/activity/activity.xhtml:userSwitcher.switchSystem&cid=595609<br />\r\n<br />\r\nhttp://ridewithgps.com/trips/1913605<br />\r\n<br />\r\nhttp://connect.garmin.com/activity/52277857<br />\r\n<br />\r\nhttp://connect.garmin.com/activity/19733659<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNOTE: There are multiple ways this ride can be done, and therefore multiple different distances/times the triple connector can be done.

In Philadelphia, the trail uses Fairmount Park trails and the Manayunk Canal towpath. In Montgomery County, the trail follows a former Pennsylvania Railroad line. The trail is the spine of the Schuylkill River Heritage Corridor, a five-county area designated as both a State and National Heritage Area.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOriginally conceived of by the Fairmount Park Commission, the trail route grew to include many municipalities. Montgomery County constructed the trail from the Philadelphia City line to Valley Forge National Historical Park. The Chester County Department of Parks and Recreation is currently planning the section between Phoenixville and Pottstown. The Schuylkill River Greenway Association is working on the sections from the Montgomery County line to Birdsboro and from Gibraltar into Reading. And finally, the Schuylkill River Development Corporation is managing the trail construction from the Water Works in Philadelphia's Fairmount Park and along the tidal section of the Schuylkill River, known as Schuylkill Banks. The Schuylkill River Greenway Association has detailed maps of each section along with construction up-dates on their website.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe river was once a major transportation resource that played a key role in the region's development. Evidence of several centuries of industrial use remain where river and canal navigation, quarrying of limestone and iron ore, and production of iron and steel have succeeded each other as mainstays of the region's economy.",

At the end of the first trail, there are cut-offs to two other trails, each about 1Â½ miles long.  Both lead to the Walnut Hill Section of Valley Forge Park; one has a little under a mile of decent singletrack.\r\n\r\n99% of this trail is strictly beginner  -  very little technical stuff, but there are long stretches where you can hammer for a few miles at a clip when the trail isn't busy.  It's also a beautiful park with lots to look at, making it worth the ride when you just want to turn the pedals for an hour or two without a lot of climbing or stump jumping.\r\n\r\nTwo special notes:\r\n1) There is another two miles of really decent singletrack hidden in the woods that are marked \"no bikes,\" apparently reserved for the horsey crowd.  I asked a park ranger if there was any good singletrack, and HE SHOWED ME THE EQUINE TRAILS!  He told me that the rangers typically don't enforce the bike restriction unless they have a horse event or they get complaints about bikes running afoul of the horses.  Rule of thumb, if you see a number of horse trailers at the Walnut Hill parking lot, stay off the marked portion of the singletrack.  Otherwise, ride at your own risk (or ask a ranger first like I did).\r\n\r\n2)  This trail runs parallel to, and easily connects to, the Schuykill River Trail and the Perkiomen Valley Trail.  Together these two trails are about 44 miles of mixed paved and unpaved surface that runs from center city Philadelphia to northwestern Montgomery County.

You get the best distance and variety by taking the outer most trails that link together in a loop that can be biked non stop in 40-70 min depending on your level of fitness and pace. The steepness of most of the hills can surprise you and requires good endurance to tackle without rest. There is a network of other trails throughout the park if you're pressed for time or want something different. Just exploring the park can be fun.

    "description": "Mixed terrain.  Beginner to intermediate.  Would rate much higher overall if the trails were longer.  Very pretty township park in nice country/suburban town.  Be prepared for wildlife encounters: deer are *everywhere* in this park.  You'll also get close to rabbits, groundhogs, skunks, foxes, oppossums, squirrels (seen them all), dozens of varieties of birds, turtles near the pond, and muskrats near the stream.  Also, as much of this track is wooded, be prepared for the occasional downed tree, fallen branches, things buried under leaves, etc.  Very low likelihood of getting lost.\r\n\r\nFigure 8 with a 1Â½-mile loop in the \"main park\" and a 1Â½-mile loop \"across the road,\" but there are a number of connecting paths and side trails.  You can ride these trails several times, connecting and reconnecting from various points, before everything starts to look the same.  Expect casual hikers and dog walkers on both sides of the road, many more on the main park side, but the main park also leaves much more room to work around them.  Also expect sports traffic near the athletic fields some afternoons and weekends.  The main park is strictly beginner level, but is still worth the ride for more seasoned riders, as the views are beautiful.  Across the road is mostly single track with several intermediate quality stretches of techy terrain.  \r\n\r\nBoth parking lots are on the main side of the park, so we'll start there.  From the parking lot on Pleasant Grove Road, face uphill towards the tennis courts (roughly northwest).  You can take off in either direction from here.  If you start to the left you will make a clockwise loop.  Look for the unpaved maintenance road heading into the woods.  After opening up into a field, look for another entrance to the woods on your left.  Quick, open, double track downhill with a few rocks, roots and plenty of loose impediments leads down to the pond.  Loop around the pond if you want.  Cut back into the woods on the far right side of the pond.  Follow the double track through the woods up to the parking lot access road.  Cut across the access road and continue on the crushed gravel path past the athletic fields back to where you started, or bear left down the hill toward South Concord Road and cross over to the second loop.\r\n\r\nThis is definitely a trail you want to ride in both directions as each offers a unique experience.  Also, if you ride here in mid-summer, wild raspberries everywhere.  Stop for a few minutes and enjoy a great snack.  This side of the track is much more challenging than the main park side.  Beginners *will* get bounced around, and I've seen a few endos here including one or two of my own.\r\nClockwise:  Cross the road and head left.  Turn right down the broken driveway keeping the cornfield on your right.  Look for an opening into the woods on the left before you reach the old farmhouse at the bottom of the hill.  Gradual climb through the woods with a few ups and downs and a few roots to keep things interesting.  Very quick downhill with switchback hairpins at the bottom brings you to the creek bottom.  Follow the single track along the creek, cross the wooden footbridge, and start the climb out of the creek bottom.  Rocks, roots, ruts and some loose terrain for a few hundred yards of moderately steep climbing.  A few hundred yards of rollers and easy climbing before emerging on the back side of the cornfield.  Keep the corn on your right until you get back to the single track in the woods.  You'll emerge at South Concord Road near where you crossed out of the main park.  Cross back and ride another loop in the main park, or turn around and reverse this loop immediately.\r\nCounterclockwise:  This time keeping the corn on your left enter the woods on your right onto the single track.  After crossing the back side of the cornfield, back into the woods for a nice rolling downhill, followed by a steep descent to the creek bottom with all the aforementioned rocks &amp; roots.  Mud &amp; loose sand at the bottom.  Follow the single track along the creek and climb the steep hill out of the creek bottom.  It's not long (only 250-300 yards) but its's steep (over 20%) and covered with slick glass.  Fun fast rollers back to the broken driveway.  Right up the driveway back to South Concord Road.",

This place is definitely on the top of the list.  You have to make a day of it, it is a very large state park. When you get here, there is a ranger station, where you can pick up a free map. The map is detailed, but some of the markings on the trails are missing. That's OK, get lost, you will have more fun. \r\nOnce in the trails,, you will see they are pretty wide for the most part. There are some tight singletracks,, not too many,, but most of all, there are some very scenic  trails to ride on. Across and actually through swampy streams,, 6 inches deep or so,, that stretch for 100 feet or so,, muddy waters,, dry rocky hills to climb and some fast rolling hills to cruise on. When I go here,, I average about 15 miles in a day at about 4 miles per hour. That usually takes at least 6 hours with stopping to look at map, etc. ,, maybe 7 and change. We go in at one spot,, and usually come out at a different point every time. There is a paved road that winds through the park, to a lake where you can jump in a canoe after riding and cool off.

That will still be a good ride of about 4 miles to the rock and back or 6 miles to the triangle of logs and back.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis trail is blazed with blue paint, It starts from the parking area's west side, look for the blue blazes, they are opposite the yellow blazes. After about 2 miles you'll come to a picnic table sized rock that looks like a terrapin, head right and down the slope, then about 1.5 miles later you'll come to a triangle of logs, go straight, you will see a \"one way\" sign up on a tree on the left side, this begins the one way mega loop of about 7 miles till you return to the picnic table terrapin rock and then go straight (not left and down hill or you'll go back to the beginning of the loop) and head back along the same trail that you rode from the parking lot. Keep your eyes open for the blue blazes that indicate a turn, if you don't see any markers, you missed a turn or are going the wrong way. There are no arrows to follow, only blue blazes. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis trails cross both hiking and horse trails.

If the ground is wet you might want to think about going to another place. \r\nThe best thing to do is to get a copy of the White Clay Creek map and fill in the trails at the Trailhead Map for Middle Run. \r\nThe Lenape Trail makes a loop around the entire natural area and is a pretty fun loop. Try Following this or just get lost and rip around until you pop back out at the Parking area. \r\n\r\nI'll try to explain a decent loop, but it's best to figure it out on your own.\r\n\r\nAt the trailhead map you will see singletrack to your right thru the field. Take this into the woods and follow it staying to your right until you get to a bridge that crosses Middle Run. After you cross the bridge you will pass a fallen tree that has been flattened on top so you can ride across it. Hang to your left and climb the trail to the top of the hill. Hang right and follow the Double track size trail down around the green water tower. This connects to the Snow Goose trail which consists of 3 spurs all connecting together. I usually hang left and follow it down to the creek and head right along the creek all the way back to the bridge. Cross back over the bridge and follow the way you came staying to the Right as trails split off to the left. This is now the Tri Valley Trail/Lenape Trail. Follow this across Fox Den Road and past Deacon's Walk Spur. You will come to an intersection of two trails. Going straight will pop you out in a development and onto Smith Mill Road. Follow this straight across Paper Mill Road to White Clay Creek State Park. Or to stay in Middle Run hang a Left up thru the field. This is a continuation of the Lenape Trail. Follow it back across Fox Den Road and stay on the Lenape Trail, there are small signs. You will come out on a Dirt road at the turn in to were you parked. Go straight across the road and get onto Double Horseshoe Trail, follow this across Possom Hollow Road down into the woods on the otherside. You can really rip thru here. Keep on the main trail it will meet back up with Lenape Trail. Take the Chapel Hill spur around. At the 3 way intersection hand Left back down into the woods. You will pop out back down at Middle Run across from the Snow Goose trail. Here you can either cross the creek on the stepping stone and follow it back or hang a left back up over the hill on Possum Hollow Trail and head right back to the trail head. \r\n\r\nThis is a good place to get lost and there is no doubt my trail directions are lacking a bit. There are new trails that are not on the maps so it's easy to head the wrong way.  So follow these directions loosely and have fun.",

Head west out of the parking lot and turn right on the gravel doubletrack and follow it for about 3000 ft. Turn left into the woods at the Yellow trail marker. The first section of this loop trends down towards Big Elk Creek and is really run. It looks like they've run a race here recently as there are many bermed turns and lots of jumps! If I'm not mistaken, this section of trail is called \"Drunken Sailor\". Follow it down to the creek and turn left on the doubletrack.  Follow the doubletack along the creek (or the singletrack slightly uphill in the woods) to the Ridge Trail leading to South Park. Take the low singletrack along the creek to the lower entrance gate of South Park. Follow fun singletrack through South Park to the upper gate.  Exit the gate and follow the ridge trail back to Big Elk Creek. Hop back on the Yellow blazed trail and ride uphill back to the parking lot - then repeat the whole thing.  We rode the same loop twice just to get back into the bermed turns and jumps on the section running down to Big Elk Creek!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n(This is my second trail submission.

Road continually changes making good practice with variety of asphalt, gravel, dirt, and plain old root earth. Great scenery, historical buildings. You'll notice a horse stable in one part where you'll see an old house built in the 1800's. Very cool.

Miles 18-22 in particular are well suited for novices as it hugs the shoreline which makes it virtually flat. This is not to say the trail is without its challenges. The length alone can be taxing to most cyclists and there are many climbs which are short in duration but steep in slope. Scenically the trail winds along the lake hugging the shore at times and veering into the woodlands at others. The trails also skirts several fields which are farmed during the warm months. The trail is multi-user and is frequented by hikers, birdwatchers and equestrians as well as bicyclists. Please keep your bike under control as there are lots of other users and many blind turns.Be sure to bring enough water, there is only one place to refill and that is inside the visitors center at a water fountain.

More recently, litigation has forced the removal of those structures (that were built illegally) in favor of smoother, flowier trails. Mountain bikers are fortunate to have access to this system at all and only continue to enjoy such access through responsible trail use.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the trails at Vassar are not unlike Stewart State Forest, and considerably easier and flowier than most other trail systems in the area. There are some technical sections, but they are generally short and non-threatening. While Vassar isn't much of a draw as a riding destination, the convenient location (the only trail system in the city of Poughkeepsie) makes it perfect for a couple of hot laps after work, or on your lunch break. Interspersed with fireroad and some doubletrack, Vassar even affords adventurous cyclocross riders an opportunity to touch wheels to dirt. \r\n\r\nIn the summer, Vassar can become taxing, as bushes, shrubbery and undergrowth often obstruct the trail. Mere feet from Vassar College, the spring and fall often find the trails occupied by runners as well, so please be courteous and respectful of other users.\r\n\r\n-Updated description by <a href=\"http://northatlanticdirt.com\" target=\"new\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NorthAtlanticDirt</a>",

With the work of a few dedicated individuals, Walnut \r\nMountain is now a public park consisting of 265 acres of hiking and biking trails. The park also \r\nfeatures picnic areas, a softball field, soccer field and a playground. The NYSMTB Series has been \r\nholding the Walnut Mtn Classic here for a few years with growing success. The course utilizes the \r\nentire mountain; intermediate single track, fire roads and really tough climbs - more than 400 \r\nfeet of elevation. There are nice views from the south side of the mountain and always a good \r\nopportunity to spot wildlife. At the summit, look out for the stone fireplace to the old hotel - really \r\ncool. Check out www.libertybiketrail.org for general information about the area and to view the \r\nrace course, go to: http://www.libertybiketrail.org/downloads/WC-Map.jpg\r\n\r\nOpen daily May 1-Sept 30, 8 am-dusk.

This write up covers the section of the trail which runs from Harford Road to Pleasantville Road and is approximately 10 miles out and back.  From the parking lot on the Baltimore County (south) side of the Little Gunpowder, enter the trail.  Trail head is right in the middle of the lot.  Follow the trail along the Little Gunpowder.  There are four stream crossings and some nice rock gardens along the trail to Bottom road.  When the trail exits onto Bottom Road, go right across the bridge over the Little Gunpowder River.  Continue on Bottom Road until you pass Laurel Brook Road on your right.  Just past Laurel Brook Road, enter the trail again on the left.  The entry is a nice steep uphill climb to a flat trail.  This section of the trail is an old railroad bed, so it's pretty flat for about .75 miles.  At several points you can see the Little Gunpowder on your left down in the valley.  Continue on the old rail trail until it abruptly ends, then turn left.  There is a nice little 2 ft. drop around the first turn.  The trail continues towards Pleasantville Road, with a couple of nice uphill sections and some rooty, technical downhill sections. Once you've reached Pleasantville Road, take a left on Pleasantville and ride across the bridge over the Little Gunpowder.  Be careful here!  The cars headed northbound on Pleasantville have a sharp, almost blind turn to get onto the bridge.  Just over the bridge, lift your bike over the guard rail and onto the trail again.  You're now in the Balto county again.  The first section of trail has a nice, technical downhill section to a small stream crossing.  The trail on this side of the L'il Gunpowder has some swooping up and downhill sections with stream crossings at the terminus of each downhill. Some fun technical sections, too.  Continue along this trail until it dumps you out onto Bottom Road again.  Come out of the woods and go left on Bottom, back down towards the L'il Gunpowder.  Enter the woods on the right before you cross the bridge and backtrack along the little Gunpowder towards Hardord Road.  At two of the stream crossings on this leg there are side loops that follow the streams uphill, cross the stream, the follow it back downhill.  One of them has a nice, small waterfall at the top.  This is a multi-use trail, and during the summer sections of it can be overgrown.  Sticker bushes, the unofficial MD state flower.  ",

    "description": "Start at the yellow gate and follow the old mining road straight. Approximately 1.3 miles into the ride there will be a large orange puddle on the road. This puddle is very deep and is easiest to cross on the left side. Continue on the old mining road until approximately 1.85 miles into the ride. The mining road will get sandy and a trail that goes through a motorcycle racetrack will be on the right. Take the trail on the right that goes through the motorcycle track. At 2.0 miles into the ride you will see an Orange/Rust colored abandoned earthmover, locally known as \"The Walking Duck\", on the left side. Follow the hill on the right of the Walking Duck to the top. At the top of this hill there will be a short downhill that leads to a short uphill, the right side is a little easier. At the top of the short uphill there will be a culmbank in the distance in front of you, a road that goes down the mountain on your extreme left, a road that bears to the left but goes to the culmbank, and an area on your right that heads up the mountain. Take the road that bears to the left and leads you to the culm banks. Follow this road up a hill and make a left at the top. Approximately 20 yards on the right side of the road there will be a single-track trail heading into the woods. Take this trail. This trail has a hill on it that is approximately 4 feet tall. After this hill you will want to bear right and head up the road with large flat rocks on it. At the top of this trail you will come to another large shale area with trees in front of you, a view of a large grassy field in the distance to your left, a sharp right road, and a road that bears right. Follow the road that bears right to a Y in the road, approximately 2.36 miles into the ride. At the Y the road, a sharp left fork leads down the mountain, don't take this road. The road on the right (may seem like the one in the middle) of the Y is what you want to take. Follow this road until you have power lines above you, a cliff to your left, and a trail that follows the power lines up the mountain on the right. Follow the trail up the power lines for two towers. Immediately after the second tower you will see a trail on your left. Follow this trail until it comes to another road. Make a right to take this rocky road up the mountain until you come to a four-way intersection. At this intersection there will be an orange and black metal box on your left approximately 3.58 miles into the ride. Take the right and continue up the mountain until you come to a red ash Y in the road. Take the trail to the right, which will take you over two small roadblocks. This road will lead you to a field. At the field there will be a sharp right and a road that bears to the right. Take the road that bears to the right and follow it through the field eventually coming to a short downhill. At the bottom of this downhill you will want to take the sharp right and head back up the mountain. Following this trail will take you into a canyon looking area with ash hills on both sides. Keep following this twisty rock filled trail up a hill. At the top of this hill, 4.5 miles into the ride, you will have the ash canyon behind you, a sharp right that goes up the mountain, and the trail continuing in front of you. Continue on the trail in front of you down a hill. At the bottom of the hill make a right and follow that trail up the mountain over a roadblock to a T in the road. Take the right up the hill until you come to a Y in the Road. The left portion of the Y will have a roadblock on it. The trail on the right is a hill about ten feet long. Take the trail to the right. At the top of the 10-foot hill you can see the community of Glen Lyon. Follow the trail up a hill to the top of this hill, where you will be approximately 5.0 miles into the ride. The trail will turn rocky and head downhill. Follow this trail for another tenth of a mile until you see a trail that heads into the woods on your right. Take the trail on your right into the woods and up the mountain. Approximately 5.37 miles into the ride you will pass off a Y in the road (keep going straight) and come to a T in the road. The T in the road has a patch of trees in the middle of it. Follow the trail to the right into the woods until you come to another Y in the road. Take the trail on the right up a rocky hill and continue on the trail. This trail will bring you to another Y in the road. Take the left. AT 5.75 miles into the ride you will be on top of the mountain with a scenic overlook of route 11, the Susquehanna River, and S.C.I Retreat on your left and a swamp on your right. Continue on the trail around the swamp until you come to a Y in the road. Take the left. Follow this single track through the woods until you come to a T in the road. Follow the mining road to the left up the hill until a path appears between the trees on your left. Follow the path down a hill past the small brick building and the old radio towers. Follow this trail until it takes a sharp right and a faint trail is on your left. Take the faint trail into the woods over the fallen trees using the tire ruts as a guide to a well-defined single-track path. Follow this path up a hill to the right through some pine trees. Try to stay to the base of the ridge through the pine trees. After making it through the pine trees you will come to a T in the road. Both the right and left go downhill to different sides of the mountain and the road straight in front of you goes up the mountain. Take the trail in front of you up the mountain. This trail is a long rocky steep uphill climb. You will come to a Y in the road. The right heads down the mountain and the left heads up the mountain. Take the left up the mountain. After some more strenuous uphill climbs you will come to another Y in the road, approximately 7.91 miles into the ride. The left heads over the mountain while the right heads up the mountain. Follow the right up the mountain until you are about 8.0 miles into the ride. Here you will be at another Y in the road. The left will take you to the top of the Power lines where you can overlook the UGI power plant, Route 11, and the Susquehanna River. The right will go uphill then downhill. At the bottom of this hill, do not follow it completely down the power lines; take the left into the woods. This trail will go down a hill with a puddle at the bottom. Continue to follow the trail down a rocky boulder field like trail, which will be tricky. This trail will have a puddle at the bottom and a path that goes to the right. Take the path to the right past the first Y in the road to the second Y in the road. The trail on the right goes down the mountain. The trail on the left goes up the mountain. Take the trail on the left. After a short distance up the mountain you will have an old mining hole on your left known locally as \"Bear ass beach\". Continue on the trail up the mountain. At 9.0 miles into the ride there will be a mud pit. Continue past the mud pit up the mountain to another Y in the road. The right will go down the mountain and the left take you to the top. Follow the trail to your left. You will pass another overlook of Route 11, the Susquehanna River, and the Garden Drive-in. The trail will turn into single track and go into the woods. Continue on the trail into the woods until you come to a T in the road. Take the left. Follow this trail to another T in the road. Take the right. You will go past an Alltel cellular tower to a Y in the road. Take the left. This trail is a fast downhill that will lead you to another yellow gate. Go around this yellow gate to the paved road and follow it down to the yellow gate you started at.\"Wissahikon Park",

This is a river valley and we all know about erosion don't we?The trails in Avalon are some very technical trails.

    "description": "The Carolina Wildlife Management Area is bordered on the North by Kenyen Hill Trail, on the South by route 91, and is bisected by Pine Hill Road.  The area contains a network of mostly doubletrack (old abandoned farm roads), and a small amount of non-technical singletrack.  The North South trail runs through the area and is marked with blue blazes.  Ignore all signs saying \"Hikers Only\", the entire area is open to MTBers.\r\nThe recomended route is bit complicated, so a map is suggested.  A good map of the area (titled \"Hiking Trails, Footpaths and Roads in Carolina and Burlingame Wildlife Management Areas\") can be purchased at the W.E. Stedman bikeshop in Wakefield.  You can also pick up a free map at the Hunter Check station in the Great Swamp Management Area.  The Carolina Management area is small enough to be explored in a single day, and makes for a good after work ride if you live in the area.  This is a Wildlife Management area, so remember to wear your 200 square inches of day-glow orange during hunting season. ",

At the bottom of the hill \r\ntake a right to the Hampden Rec Park.  Go to Main St and take a left, go about 200yds and take \r\nleft onto North Rd then take right at Green Meadows School.  Go along the parking lot to the back \r\nleft of the school yard where trail picks up again.  Ride trail taking a right then left where you will \r\nbe along a stream.  Follow trail keeping right along stone fences.  Keep staying right up a hill and \r\nthen take right over rock water fall.  Rest for an impossible climb along the power lines.  After \r\nthe second climb take the trail to the left.  Stay straight on this trail that winds down to a stream \r\nand up to a farm which leads to North Rd.  Cross road to down hill driveway and take right into \r\nsmall field, trail will pick up on the left.  Get ready for a killer climb that does not stop!  Once you \r\nhave made it take the trail right to a dirt driveway to Burleigh Rd.  Take a left for an enjoyable \r\nride (paved) downhill, careful of cars going up though.  This will put you back on Main St take a \r\nleft back to starting point.  Good place to stop for Java and donuts is Rice's Fruit Farm on Main St. ",

It consists of a lot of tight twisty singletrack with some short steep hills built and designed in cooperation with IMBA's trail building guru and former trail crew member Rich Edwards. There are beautiful overlooks, awesome flora and fauna, large open fields. The trails offer something for all levels, but tend toward moderate speed singletrack, with moderate climbs, and most of the trail is under the cool canopy of mature hardwoods. Some technical sections will require beginners to dismount, but intermediate riders should find most sections rideable and challenging. Trails are not crowded, but keep a close eye out for the occasional equestrian rider or hiker.\n\nCost for park access is $3 per Md. car and $4 per out of state vehicle. Ride in access is free so park at the nearby shopping center and ride in! Trail maps are available at the Mt. Airy mansion on the other side of the park off Rosaryville Rd. 8-4 weekdays or at the Cedarville Park complex or on the DNR web site at http://www.dnr.state.md.us/publiclands/trailguides.html",

To get to the top of Paulina's Peak,, is about 7 miles from the parking lot up the gravel fire road. So,, approx 25-26 miles total.. You have to climb to the top to see the views. This is not a technical ride by any means,, it is just a great workout and quite a scenic tour. The trail is mostly rolling hills,, up and down,, few roots from trees to go over,, and lots of cinder and volcanic ash all over. Soft terrain. The last 3-4 miles is a downhill bomber,, with a few rail road tie sized wood to jump over. Then that dumps right out into the parking lot.  Nice ride.",

Heading south on this trail is traveling upstream on the river thus some elevation is gained, about 300 ft going this direction. This is a very well planned and built trail that runs through several park areas along the river that can be very busy with other users at times. Most all of these areas are accessed off of Road 41 and offer numerous starting points. Along the section between the Big Eddy Rec site and Dillon Falls (about 2.5 miles) there are a couple different routes all marked by different signage, there are also maps at all the kiosks along the way. Although the route nearest the river is always open to MTB through here it is encouraged to use the alternate MTB route during high use times- summer weekends, holidays, etc.<br />\r\nThe trail itself is a great singletrack that climbs and descends ridges as it follows the river. There is a little technical area within the first couple miles but after that it is a fantastic novice/intermediate ride through the woods. Scenery along the way is incredible, with many waterfalls, lava rock formations and wildlife to see. As you near Benham Falls there are a couple trails heading west away from the river, these climb up to Benham Butte and beyond. Following the river trail past Benham Falls brings you to a footbridge across the river and another 2.5 miles of great trail to Sun River. A left turn after the footbridge will lead along the Blackrock trail through the lava fields 4 miles to the Lava Lands Visitor Center on Highway 97.",

Even the other trails in the region that aren't actually part of the Phil's Trail System feed into or connect to trails that feed into Phil's. \r\n\r\nAccording to the locals, and for the purpose of our trail listings, the boundaries of the Phil's Area Trail System is a square comprised of Skyliners Road to the north, Highway 46 (Cascade Lakes Scenic Byway) to the south, Bend to the east, and the Storm King trail to the west.\r\n\r\nThis complex trail system offers a variety of different trails, but on average the trails are very buff, very flowy, with some great corners to rail. The trail tread is quite loose and sandy, and gets very dry, especially late in the season, leading to \"moon dust\" conditions. Here and there you'll find some rock gardens, skinnies, and sections of flow trail with big jumps and massive berms! All of the difficult sections do feature ride arounds, making this an extremely beginner-friendly area.\r\n\r\n<b>Previous Listing:</b>\r\n\r\nThis route goes along a popular trail close to town and is ideal for mountain biking.

These are singletrack but are wider and flatter than most MTB trails. There are large brown signs within the Snow Park area marking the ski routes and although good for determining location they can mislead someone on a MTB route, once again a map of the area comes in really handy. Immediately upon setting off from the parking area you will come across a Y and one of these brown signs telling you the Swedes Ridge Loop is to the right- in order to avoid a lot of dirt road riding take a left here and follow the trail 2 miles all the way to the Swampy Lakes Shelter, passing a few other singletracks along the way. The trail leading north behind the shelter will lead you down 1000â€™ to the Tumalo Falls area. Staying on the Swedes Ridge Loop the trail from here gets tighter and more technical. Stay left at the next intersection (signed) and follow the trail 2 miles out the ridge on a fast & twisty trail with plenty of opportunities for viewing the surrounding mountains and canyon below. The trail suddenly stops at a FS road at the ridges point, lots of good views here. There is the option here for continuing on straight all the way down to join in the Philâ€™s Trail Network some 6 miles away. To stay on the Swedes Loop look right as soon as you hit the road, there is an unmarked singletrack disappearing back into the trees not more than 20 yards away. This is another fun section of tight trail through dense trees. Drops, switchbacks and a couple man-made skinnies await the rider along this 1.5 mile section until the route joins back in with a ski trail. Another 1.5 miles farther and you come to a 4-way intersection, go straight through this for another half mile and you come back to the main trail that heads to Swampy Lakes Shelter you started on, go left and its 1 fun mile back down to the parking area.

Basically this is an 18 mile loop with no less than 12 â€˜connectorâ€™ trails running between the two sides, PT West &amp; PT East- the ride lengths and different configurations here are almost endless. The local bike shop boasts 28 miles of trails, I guess so if you were to ride them all. The local bike shops and the Forest Service office have free maps available. Like the neighboring systems in Bend all the intersections are marked by a post with a number on it, these correspond with the maps- as you are riding along these #â€™s are not necessarily in order so having a map, at least for the first time here is kind of important.<br />\r\nAlthough not direction specific I chose to ride the loop counter-clockwise (turning right at every intersection) and for the first 2.5 miles the trail was just a twisty, flat ride through the woods, great for the novice riders. After that there was a slight elevation gain and some semi-technical spots mainly in the form of small rock gardens. The views from the ridge of the surrounding mountains are spectacular. At intersection #28, about 8.5 miles from the start you will want to turn left onto PT East, turning right here leads to the Upper Metolius trail- it is possible to ride singletrack from here all the way to the numerous trail systems in Bend. Back on the loop the trail turns very fast and winds its way back down the ridge towards Sisters. Take a left at intersection #2 near the end as going right will take you to the Five Pine Resort (this is plainly marked). There are several FS roads running through this area and you will cross them frequently, however this trail is all singletrack and if you find yourself riding on a road you somehow missed a turn-<br />\r\nThese are very well planned and built trails and the signage is some of the best I have ever seen on a system this size.",

The best part of this trail is not the loop around the lake however but the ride slightly descending from Suttle Lake that connects you to Black Butte Loop trails near the Sherman Camp turn-off of hwy 22.  This part of the trail is called the Suttle Lake Tie trail.  It rides very fast and winds through beautiful woodland.  The first mile nearest the lake does get pretty tight with dense shrubbery whacking at you so maneuver carefully.  The trail is quite smooth and very negotiable for beginners nonetheless.  A few sandy areas might trip you up in a few spots during dry months.  Since I was staying at Suttle Lake at the time I just traveled the trail to the connection point of the Black Butte Loops and then back again.  The descent from Suttle Lake was gradual enough that the return trip was only slightly more difficult.   I definitely will be coming back to explore further.  From the Sherman Creek turnoff and Black Butte Loops you can also connect to a trail that takes you to Sisters.  I will be back to experience those trails soon.",

It crosses the creek once, about 1/2 mile from the trailhead. At approximately 2 miles up the trail, the junction with the old trail to Marble Pass to the south is still visible. From that point the trail traverses an open hillside meadow resplendent with wildflowers in the summer. Mountain goats are often seen in their haunts on the ridge west of the Twin Lakes basin. A large flat meadow just above the eastern shore of the lakes provides an ample camping area and grazing for horse; other camping areas exist between the two lakes. via fs.usda.gov",

Continue on gravel road for ~300 feet and trail will once again be on the left, but this time as pristine singletrack for 2.7 miles. Echo trail is rarely used, but has some great features that make it completely scenic and worth riding. It is an undulating trail with beautiful, CCC built stone switchbacks that crosses over water streams complete with beautiful mossy rocks. Includes some punchy climbs and rad descents. Little, very natural side hits can be found on occasion if you're looking and willing to shred through some salal.  Trail drains well due to rocky soil and is, despite not being ridden much, very easy to navigate and clear of most brush and thusly in great condition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPersonal favorite way to ride this is to park/take bus to King-Castle Trailhead and ride up K-C to where it meets the Castle Rock trail, I then head down Castle Rock (lower, less used section) and ride that to the end. I will then proceed to ride up the very, very last portion of of O'Leary to the first (or last, depending on direction) road crossing and then descend the road approximately 500 feet to the start of Echo trail (on left, marked with sign). I do an OAB on this route. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlternative way would be to include it as a finisher, or start to an O'Leary ride by parking at the end of O'Leary, then riding Echo to the 1993 road (East fork parking lot just below) and then riding up the 1993 to the top of O'Leary (or Ollalie).",

The two trails share a common pathway for the initial 0.5 miles which then forks high atop either side of the creek's ravine and continue downhill to create an inverse elevation profile. Either direction you choose, you're going down right out the gate with a grueling climb back to the car.<br />\r\nPerched 2,000 feet above the creek, both trails sweep opposite sides of the ravine's steep slope diving and stretching deeper and further into the firmament. Ancient volcanic rock fields stationed on exposed cliffside guard the eastern Oregon expanse almost as if it were Mother Nature's personal watchtower. The ground is a perfect medley of rock, root, needle-pack, volcanic moondust, and black gold. I think \"loam\" actually sums it up nicely.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Cedar Creek descent ends with a sharp ridge descent over such an amount of pumice and baby head, I hardly recognized any evidence of a trail before popping back onto clay at Fifteen Mile Creek's river bottom. The initial climb out on the 15-Mile trail begins easy enough, but shortly after the mellow grade ascent, we were met with long stretches of hillside hike-a-bike punctuated by more outcroppings of rock. Once back on top, the trail continues climbing in earnest, but can be done so pedaling all the way back to the car.",

Continue another 0.6 miles to the intersection with Winberry Divide Trail.<br />\r\nThe Tie Trail is all uphill, and tends to get a little overgrown with brush in places. The Divide Trail consists of a series of climbs followed by downhill sections. The trail is fairly smooth with few rocks, roots or other obstacles, although it is a little rutted from wet weather use in places. Expect lots of switchbacks and plenty of exertion. No matter which direction you are going here, it's work! The return trip is a bit easier, though. It starts and ends with fast, fun downhill runs--especially the last mile down the Tie Trail to your car. It's a little treacherous at first, but quickly turns to fairly smooth , fast downhill with some tight switchbacks and a lot of whoop-de-doos. Watch out for both of these.<br />\r\nAt several places the trail dumps you out on Forest Service or old logging roads. The continuations are easy to find, though, as they are never more that 100 ft. or so from where you come out. The signage is generally poor, so take a good map and compass. Also, take all the water you will need as there is none available here during the summer months.<br />\r\nThe total pedaled elevation gain for the whole ride is nearly 4,500 ft. due to the ups and downs of the Divide Trail. The overall actual gain is considerably less, however. If, when you reach the east trailhead, you've still got the itch to go futher, continue on the Tire Mountain Trail to the mountain or beyond to Alpine Trail.

After a large log bridge, the trail leaves the creek and climbs to a junction with Goodman Creek Rd. Cross the road to a small parking area and continue on the trail.<br />\r\nIf you opt for the gravel road start, climb pleasant Goodman Creek Rd. for about 3 miles to the aforementioned junction and head up the trail to the right toward Eagle's Rest. From this point onward, the trail becomes more technically challenging with plenty of rocks and roots to traverse, and a number of tough but short pitches to climb. About .5 mile short of the end of this section, you'll come upon an historic wooden shelter. Continue past the shelter to a junction with paved Eagle's Rest Rd. Don't stop here, though. The reward just up the hill across the road is well worth the additional effort.<br />\r\nEagle's Rest Trail climbs about 1.5 miles to the peak of this mountain with views westward toward Eugene and the Coast Range, and eastward toward Sawtooth Ridge and Mount June (both of which have MTB trails). From the peak down your reward is rich indeed: mile after mile of sometimes technical, sometimes smooth and fast singletrack through the western fringe of the Cascade Range's heavily forested woodlands. You'll pass through groves of massive old growth Douglas Firs and Red Cedars, along the banks of cool and clear Goodman Creek, and into the stuff mountain biker's dreams are made of.<br />\r\nIf you're all tuckered out on the way back down, take Goodman Creek road from the lower junction to your car. If not, get ready for the smoothest and fastest section of the trail. This reward, however, has its own price. Although it's technically downhill, it doesn't really feel like it. It consists of a number of fairly steep, moderately technical climbs followed by fast and furious downhills. <br />\r\nThe condition of this and all other trails in the area can vary greatly from season to season. The lower elevation ones should all be avoided during wet weather, and many of the higher trails are routinely blocked with fallen trees and/or snow until late spring. Expect to encounter hikers.",

Although it starts mellow with a few big boulders and a couple of scree fields, the excitement and challenge ramp up quickly after fording Little Joe Creek. From there, the trail drops 350 feet in the next mile with some exposure and big grade reversals.\n\nAt the bottom make a right and dump out to Homestead and pedal back up to the top.\n\nThe second helping will have your your legs and arms burning by then end. Tackle Rock Drop, a short climb to access Communication Breakdown. Settle in for a bit more pedaling - you'll be rewarded with a couple of stellar views and a steady descent to Quid Pro Flow. From here enjoy some jump action with big tables, rollers and a few hips.\n\nRoll into Three Thirty Eight for a short connection to Two Turntables and a Microwave. Drop in off a shallow rock slab and then whip through a few tight berms. From there the trail stretches out and travels pretty fast into a big berms. The bottom portion of the trail is fast, loose and tight. Have fun and hang on tight!\n\nJoin Hide and Seek briefly above a major creek crossing. Check your speed before rumbling over the wet armored section that make a tight right hand turn into a bridge. From here, ride the Hide and Seek connector back out to Homestead Road.\n\nAnd now for the finale!\n\nTurn left and pedal up a short distance to the Flow Motion connector. Take a right and pedal up a bit and then bear right again.\n\nReady for some fun? Charge down Flow Motion, a trail with incredible soil and more than fifteen berms. The trail drops 275 feet through a Douglas Fir and Hemlock forest.\n\nFinish the ride by transitioning to long carving tuns of lower Hide and Seek.\n\nPrevious Description:\n\nThree trails have been completed so far for a total of about five miles. Hide and Seek is an intermediate, four-mile descent dropping from an elevation of 2,280 feet to 1,120 with roots, rocks,rollers and jumps built into the trail.

The entire trail is well gravelled and well maintained. It gains around 1,000 ft. and is technically easy, but aerobically moderate.\nThe first section climbs gradually at first, then becomes a little steeper as it follows a tree-lined canon across several bridges and through a number of switchbacks. It pops out into a large gravel parking lot on Fox Hollow Rd.\nThe second section is to the left. Take the lower of two paths as the upper is for foot traffic only. This section rolls and twists along a wide, smooth path for about 3/4 mi. until it climbs the last 1/4 mile through two switchbacks to another gravel parking lot on Dillard Rd. Resist the temptation to go too fast (as the trail fairly begs you to) because there are frequent hikers and other riders on this trail.\nThe third and final (and steepest) section begins in a paved parking area about 3/4 mi. to the north on Dillard Rd. Here, too, there are two trails. Take the one on the right that passes under the power lines and across an access road. Continue to climb steeply till you reach an intersection of trails. The lookout--complete with a beautiful memorial bench-- is to the left a couple hundred yards.\nIf you want more riding, and a lot more exercise, go to the right at the aforementioned intersection and follow this trail to its terminus on Spring Boulevard. Turn around and ride back up this steep, switchback-filled singletrack.\nThese three sections are the only ones open to bikes. Please respect this as the local parks dept. may choose to close all trails to MBs if folks abuse what we do have.",

This is still a fast ride. It is not steep. This trail will take you behind the state patrol station, but continue pass it heading south. We will then come to two trail signs; the first is \"Woody's\" and the second \"Mainstreet\". I prefer the ride on \"Woody's\" so i will guide you from there. Take \"Woody's\" and continue to ride south. Then take the trail called \"Freeway\" and continue south as it takes you close to the freeway. This trail has many sharp switch backs. The \"Freeway\" trail will take you to the edge of a farm where it curves to the left and heads east. You are now on top of all the trails. Ride east to connect with the trails you wish to take to the bottom. The first trail is unmarked but widely known as \"bigtire\". This is trail is not steep, but can be very fast and has many jumps, both natural and man-made. If you continue east along the farm however the trails become steeper and less ridden. The next trails you can ride are in order as follows: Fred&amp;Jons, X-cut, Baja, Slalom, Giant Slalom, Skateboard, Bump-n-Grind, Lost-n-Found, then the main trail on top \"Freeway\" curves left and turns in to the last trail called \"Slime\".

    "description": "\"Whypass Trail\" is a bit of a misnomer as this is actually a system of interconnected trails that run through the forested hills on both sides of the paved BLM road the parking lot is on. Although this web of singletrack can seem a bit confusing, there is little chance of actually getting lost since virtually every rideable section of it eventually leads back to the road.<br />\r\nThe trails here vary from narrow and unimproved to fairly wide, much improved singletrack designed specifically for MTBing. The latter of these are excellent in quality and include features such as large, well-constructed berms and jumps-things you won't find on the Forest Service trails in this area. They also differ from those trails in that they don't go anywhere. That is, there are no rivers, lakes, connectors, hinterland shelters, alpine meadows or sweeping vistas to be had. The trail is what it is: a MTB trail. But it is an excellent one.<br />\r\nNowhere are the trails excessively rocky or rooty, and the majority of them are exceptionally smooth, winding and fast. There are a number of switchbacks and several fairly steep, but mostly short, climbs. Anyone riding here can expect to enjoy hours of exploration, or hours of finding and riding favorite (and exhilarating) loops. The variations are seemingly endless.<br />\r\nThere is very little signage on the system, and no official map that depicts it in its entirety, so come prepared to explore. Also, there are no perennial water sources, so bring as much as you'll need.",

If you can pick your lines though, it is an absolute blast.  I can not say enough about the area.  I am not going to say it is the greatest place ever, simply because my experiance is limited, but out of the place I have ridden, including the McKenzie River Trail, east of Eugene, McDonald can not be beat.

This part of the trail is in great shape and fun as well. In just past 3 miles you arrive at Bolt Camp. There is a cabin here maintained by a forest service worker in his spare time. Just past Bolt Cabin there is a small landslide and a larger one a little distance up. Hike a bike can be done over the slides if careful. In a couple more miles the trail climbs up to the bluff and winds along above the river. The upper section of the trail goes past the Lower Falls Campground. This trail gains more elevation than it looks like on the map but it's worth it. Considered by most as one of the best low elevation trails in the state. This trail has become famous not only from word of mouth but has been featured in several magazines and calendars. Motorized use is not allowed on this trail. It is part of the C to C Route. The trail goes along high cliffs, especially in the falls area. The beauty of the area is awesome and so are the drop offs. Use extreme caution, along all areas next to the river. There are some areas worth walking where the trail is narrow. See web site at ebiketrails.com<BR><BR><BR><BR>",

Don't despair, the view at the top is worth the effort. The climb is, however, brutal. It's mostly rideable for stronger riders, with a few hike-a-bike sections for the rest of us. Once you cap out at the top, there are a few lovely spots to take a few photos and give your legs a break. Then enjoy some flowy downhill for the next 1.5 miles. \r\n\r\nEnjoy the next few miles of a mostly relaxed and easy-to-ride singletrack, with only a few a few short climbs. \r\n\r\nAt mile 4.1 you'll enter a clear cut area. Stay on the trail until you hit a logging road then hang a left and climb up and around a small hairpin corner. At mile 4.5 (ish) you'll see the trail on the left hand side of the road. Drop off the road onto more singletrack goodness. Continue on until you hit the campground. Take a break before reversing and heading back to Moulton. \r\n\r\nFor the rider looking for more adventure, head out of the campground and hang a right down L-1000 to Larch Mt. Or pick your way over to the Cold Creek campground and Tarbell (L-1000 to Dole Valley and a left down to the campground)",

With its massive tree canopy and substantial undergrowth, the park serves as a natural air purifier, water collector, and erosion controller. The 30-mile Wildwood Trail in Forest Park is part of the region's 40-Mile Loop system that links Forest Park to pedestrian and trail routes along the Columbia River to Gresham, through southeast Portland, along the Willamette Greenway, and back to the Marquam Trail in southwest Portland. A landmark on the trail is the Stone House. This structure was built in the mid-1930s by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) as a public restroom. The infamous Columbus Day storm on October 12, 1962, took out the water line. Because the structure had been heavily vandalized over the years, the decision was made to gut the building rather than embark on costly repairs. It remains as a favorite spot to rest along the trail.",

    "length": "26.0",
    "description": "From the trailhead at the top of the Smith Creek drainage, take a good long look downstream at your hike-a-bike future. If you are still inclined to surf the pum down into Smith Creek (and then pedal back out), go back to your car and load up on more energy bars, warm clothes, and a flashlight for good measure (even though you're making a decision that doesn't make much good sense). With a few more racks of fig bars in tow, start down Smith Creek Trail 225 on an easy traverse that belies the radical drop-off that lurks around the first corner.\r\n\r\nSerious pum surfing and switchbacking hike-a-bike begin as the trail careens down the wide ridge toward the creek. In some sections the trail is distinct, compact, and ridable; in others, no trail seems to exist as wands and red f**ing guide you through dense shrubbery and across washouts. Near the valley floor on a long, westward traverse, the trail becomes even more difficult to follow despite the f**ing. Stick with it and you will eventually find wood posts that mark the route across the small middle fork of Smith Creek, 3.6 miles.\r\n\r\nAcross the creek, find the faint trail and bear left, riding down the long rise between the two forks of Smith Creek. Use the tall wood posts to follow the trail, which is sometimes obvious and fast, other times difficult to follow and slow. At 5.1 miles, the trail abandons the rise between forks, bearing right and crossing Smith Creek's west fork. \r\n\r\nWHOA! From here the trail is again difficult to follow. Across the creek, bear left and hike-a-bike south. With luck you will soon find the trail. At 6.3 miles, the trail crosses Ape Canyon Creek. Watch the route carefully: It is crucial to cross at the correct spot so you can find the trail that heads away from the creek, climbing. Hike-a-bike to the 6.7-mile point.\r\n\r\nFrom here, the trail opens up and becomes considerably more ridable. At around 8 miles the trail again climbs away from Smith Creek. At 8.4 miles, the trail widens to become an old road. Follow the road down, ignoring both a spur road and then Trail 184, both on the right. Continue down the road to the creek that flows out of Lava Canyon. Only half the bridge remains - a washout - requiring a dangerous ford. From the opposite side, ride down the road, FR 8322, passing a gravel parking area and a lesser spur road on the right.\r\n\r\nAt 9.7 miles, the low point of the ride, FR 8322 bears right and begins climbing out of the Smith Creek valley. The road heads up at a steady climb. Pass a spur road on the left at 10.3 miles. At 13.6 miles, ignore a spur back to the left. When you reach a T at 13.9 miles, turn right. At 14.4 miles, reach another T - turn right on paved FR 83. The paved road drops, crosses the appropriately named Muddy River, and ends at Ape Canyon Trailhead.\r\n\r\nFrom the trailhead, pedal up Ape Canyon Trail 234, tracing the east edge of**igantic mudflow. After some relatively easy twists and turns, the trail enters a forest of big trees and mounts a ridge that - amazingly - escaped much of the St. Helens eruption unscathed. The trail, steep and unrelenting though smooth and ridable, switchbacks up the ridge through a seemingly normal forest. However, occasional views off the ridge of trees strewn like matchsticks and huge, gray mudflows prove how anomalous this small patch of forest is so close to Mount St. Helens.\r\n\r\nBy the 19-mile mark, most of the difficult climbing is over. At 19.6 miles, stop to appreciate the haunting views of the mountain above and Ape Canyon below. Reach a fork, 20.1 miles, and bear right. Soon after, the trail bends north and enters the Plains of Abraham, a gigantic pumice shoulder on the east side of Mount St. Helens, which is peppered with black rocks that seem to float in the pumice like miniature icebergs. The trail across the Plains of Abe is fun and quick with some ups and downs; watch out for other trail users and yield to them all. At 21.9 miles, the trail forks: Go right.\r\n\r\nThe trail traverses, winding in and out of several drainages before emerging at the top of a knife-edged ridge, 23.2 miles. The trail mimics the top of the ridge as it heads down. You will need to carry your bike down several sets of stairs that begin at 23.5 miles. After negotiating the stairs, continue down the ridge top. At 24 miles, reach a dirt road and turn right. Climb up this gated dirt road toward Windy Ridge Viewpoint. At 25.8 miles, arrive at the viewpoint parking area. Bear to the right on the paved road, FR 99, and continue the ascent back up to Smith Creek trailhead on the right, 27.4 miles, to complete the loop. (Taken from NWsource)\r\nFR 99 IS CLOSED AT THE BEAR MEADOWS VIEWPOINT, SO BE PREPARED TO ADD  22 MILES TO YOUR LOOP.  We had to do quite a bit more hike a bike then what is written in the trail description due to the loose nature of pumice but, there was plenty of great singletrack and the views are simply amazing.

There is a wide mix of green to double black trails including trails with creek gaps, 40 foot jumps, and some of the steepest tech I have seen. My favorite trails include Skeet Chute, Twisted Knickers, Upper and Lower Roller Coaster, and Simba's Line. Coastal and Simba's are the two main jump trails, with Twisted Knickers being a mix between tech and flow. Lower Roller Coaster has some of the best tech around with some great optional lines. They have just added a new trail called Twisted Sisters which features a Pro Line. This place is great and gets better every time as it is continually being updated.I have only ridden these trails once with a buddy who lives near here and don't know much about them. There are no maps available that I have found. The trails are a network of tight singletrack with some fun, short steep climbs and descents with some great roots, jumps and woops thrown in randomly. It seems to be over an area with 3 or 4 hills but overall elevation change is small. There are some quick, tight sections which make this place fun. If I lived in Stumptown, I would definitely head out here after work for some stress relief. Go explore, you can't really get lost b/c all the trails lead back to the same road.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

The trail follows the ridge line for 4.5 miles to the base of Sunrise Peak, then drops down to a meadow and pond, before climbing back to the ridge. The trail skirts Juniper Peak, Sunrise Peak and Jumbo Peak. The trail ends near Dark Meadows at Boundary Trail #1. Improvements are being planned. Check with Randle District for current information. Much of the trail along the open ridgetop takes you through an area that burned in 1902 and 1918, resulting in the beautiful meadows along the ridge today. This is a fun trail but with some more difficult sections. This trail was once used by sheepherders as a \"stock driveway\" from 1900 to the 1930s. Look for an old watering trough north of Jumbo Peak. This is a motorized trail but does not get a lot of use. It is part of the C to C Route.\"\r\n",

There is a good push to the top level, then there is a \"circuit\" around the top that is pleasing. There will be some jumps being put in up top.

The trail builders did a fantastic job keeping the grade mild. Once again the trail traverses along the hillside for a little while before entering a rocky canyon. The trail has a few sections of rocks that are fairly technical but overall the trail has a good flow to it which makes it really enjoyable.  In this rocky section you will junction with Sweet Connies and then continue your way up to Bogus Basin Rd.  We did this as an out and back and logged around 11.3 mIles and 1650 ish feet of climb.

    "description": "This trail starts out easy and becomes more difficult as you climb higher into the foothills.  There are detailed marker posts along the way to guide you to the multiple loops in the area.  The best trail for those who love a good workout and some fairly challanging single track is to follow the markers to the kestrel trail which climbs gradually at first and soon turns to a more aggresive incline followed by ridge riding for about 3 miles.  At this point you can take the Sidewinder trail which is a rugged dirt and sand singletrack carved out only by those who have gone before you, as its name says it twists and turns as it climbs into the clouds and towards the treeline.  Once you reach the top of sidewinder you can continue up if you so choose on trail #4 or begin the decent on trail #4 by turning to the left, this connects with the Hulls gulch trail.  This again is an aggressive singletrack downhill with plenty of bumps and rocks to manuver around.  In general the ride would be suited for anyone familiar with basic downhill riding and a good cardio routine in place beforehand.  As this is one of the most popular rides in the Boise area it is known to the locals as the freeway and you will always have company during the 2 hour trek.",

    "description": "Deadwood Ridge Trail\r\n\r\n(The 17 miles listed is the length of the GPX file, that is, one way. The shortest distance out from there is another 10 miles.)\r\n\r\nIâ€™m listing this as an â€œup and backâ€ because my GPS cut out before the return trip of the extreme downhill down through deadwood river gulch. I will describe the options once you get to the end of the trip as posted at the end of the description.\r\n\r\nThe GPX file starts at the Julie Creek road parking area. The reason we started here is, itâ€™s a nice parking spot with an outhouse and there is a smooth gradual downhill to get you warmed up. Start by going back down the road you drove up and once you get to the end, cross the bridge over to the Deadwood camp site. From here you will clearly see the trailhead. This is an 17 mile climb that will test you and try to break you the whole way. The first mile or so itâ€™s almost impossible to climb without the front wheel of the bike coming off the ground. Then it winds up the mountain eventually breaking out around the side of the ridgeline giving you spectacular views of the mountain ranges and the deadwood river gulch below. There is very little relief from climbing along this track. There is about a 2 mile stretch that takes you down to the east fork of  Stevenâ€™s Creek. This proved to be a much needed landmark for cooling off and wetting down. Then the climb continues up to the Stevenâ€™s Point trailhead. From here these are your options:\r\n\r\nYou can climb to Stevenâ€™s Point for the view of a lifetime.\r\n\r\nYou can ride ahead a little further down to the next intersection which has the option of finishing the loop by taking Julie Creek Trail. This is a treacherous downhill with a lot of exciting twists.\r\n\r\nIf youâ€™re really crazy you can keep going to Whitehawk Basin which is another 9 miles and continue on to Deadwood RSVR which is about five miles from Cascade.\r\n\r\nOr you can turn around and come down the way you came.\r\n\r\nAt this point the only option you will feel like taking is â€œLife Flightâ€ Membership is $350.00 a year.\r\n\r\nIf you take option two. This is what you should know. While at this point you would expect it to be all downhill from here, itâ€™s not the case. It will be a mixture up uphill, downhill and a lot of switchbacks for the next 5 miles. Your back tire will be locked up for most of the way until you get to the end of the single track. At this point you have you have a 6 mile dirt road that takes you along the river crossing the occasional creek and sand trap to the parking lot where you started.\r\n\r\nWe just started biking seriously this year. We have about 6 months or Boise Foothills experience and around 250 single track miles under our belt. This trail kicked our ass. It took us 12 hours and we climbed just under 4000 feet. I would not suggest this for just anyone, but I will say this, that was one hell of an accomplishment and Iâ€™m glad I did it. I just wonâ€™t be doing it again any time soon.\r\n\r\nPeace Out!\r\n",

At roughly 3600' the real fun begins when switchbacks come into play.  The last two miles are brutal on the legs and lungs, but the views of the surrounding peaks are incredible.  The trail tops out at around 4400'.  After a rest and refuel at the top, take the trail back down and enjoy some of the smoothest singletrack in the state.  It's fast, dry and demanding on the body, but well worth the extensive climb to the top.  I would recommend the in and out route of this trail versus taking the fire road up.  Take plenty of fluid and energy bars for this one folks!!!",
